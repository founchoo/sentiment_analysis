 family mormon have never tried explain them they still stare puzzled from time time like some kind strange creature nonetheless they have come admire for the patience calmness equanimity acceptance and compassion have developed all the things buddhism teaches ,1
buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design ,1
seriously don say thing first all they won get its too complex explain normal people anyway and they are dogmatic then doesn matter what you say see mechante post and for any reason you decide later life move from buddhism and that doesn suit you identity though you still get keep all the wisdom then your family will treat you like you went through weird hippy phase for while there didncha and you never hear the end pro tip don put one these your wall jpg ,-1
what you have learned yours and only yours what you want teach different focus the goal not the wrapping paper buddhism can passed others without word about the buddha ,0
for your own benefit you may want read living buddha living christ thich nhat hanh you might find any subsequent discussions with your loved ones easier you are able articulate some the parallels that exist between buddhism and christianity don surprised they react negatively for having lost you treat them with compassion and deserved understanding although they may indeed display signs being hurt your new path properly sharing with them way that may alleviate their fear something they may perceive wrong the very least alien their beliefs may help allowing them the long run accept although not necessarily agree with your decision regardless where they end you have make your own way ,1

 was teens when discovered zen meditation was then undiagnosed bpd being homeschooled and just gotten 56k modem with web connection where came across link zen meditation tried for couple weeks and the change was palpable felt the most profound sense peace ever felt grades immediately started going had more energy started martial arts just huge positive change all around parents asked something was wrong fundie parents when anything changes this was where naivet√© kicked foolishly told them been trying meditation and really calmed down thought they happy that found something that helped but never forget what happened next mother affected this mockingly calm breathy voice she said you can pretend calm and happy all you want but without jesus you never content was that moment that any belief had christian faith all vanished completely realized that she had probably never been happy ever have never felt profoundly sorry for someone did for her that moment ,1

there are two varieties christians dogmatic that dwell words and conservative that take heart the spirit the teachings hate oversimplify things but helps this understanding you are discussing with dogmatic religious people who live the letter the law will uphill battle wish you luck you are discussing with moderates exchange idea should come fairly easily comparing contrasting also discussing parallel teachings presented differently wouldn out the ordinary they may give you relevant spiritual advice even though you are not believer their religion ,-1
dont worry about trying explain yourself just meditate regularly and try hard you can more aware everything else will follow coming from someone who has been throught his situation welcome pms ,1
 recently told family that buddhist live the bible belt this whole ordeal involved leaving the baptist church and everything been pretty rough but those who really care about have been open and accepting they seen the good has created life and relationships with others fact there are handful christians who have lovely conversations with and that truly respect someone else suggested living buddha living christ great one read about the important dialogue between buddhists and christians also welcome you message ,1
 unto others you would have them unto you would good start ,1
first understand that you are not anyway control how they will react always find that any subject better understood first learning the vocabulary explain what the word buddha means most people believe buddhists praise worship and follow guy named buddha christians due jesus let them know that one could both buddhist and christian with conflict the teachings and the messages jesus are indeed buddhist philosophy jesus became enlightened buddha and realized that had become annointed being christ then continue with your practice and let them work out their own issues that advice all the best ,1
 recently heard similar question where person asked they should introduce meditation his loved ones who had challenges coping with problems life the answer from the lama was quite interesting instead giving people advice one should focus his practice that way others will see the change and maybe even ask about personally think better keep yourself even though you must really excited about you can also keep dharma books around the house and sure people will pick them for quick browse when you are not looking learn bit about other people traditions well browsing through books they owned ,1
different times different cultures same point they were trying get across jesus said god has beginning nor end buddha said mind was never born and has never died just replace the word meditation with prayer and couting the breath with the name jesus and everyone happy,1

 always liked vecna the one time was able use him story had blast playing the fact that was far not the most powerful deity but was one the most dangerous due his portfolio but favorite pale night who technically not deity but close enough guess most the abyssal lords and the rulers the nine hells are fairly straightforward and have ample backstory but her lack thereof just intriguing ,1
though don have any good suggestions for additional deities the moment you should probably have some overlap the cavern dwelling gnolls might consider pelor the god evil blinding them with his wicked light loki has sufficiently fooled them over the years into thinking their benefactor always leading them the bountiful crops they steal from the peasantry they have statues him fat woman giving out food the starving they view the god death the god justice giving righteous end those gnolls that have served brutal conflicts point view can change everything ,-1

zon kuthon and his sister shelyn good deity have really cool story from the pathfinder setting plus off topic pathfinder has the coolest good deity ever cayden cailean was bard that got wasted one night stumbled into the temple the star stone artifact that can turn you into deity and woke the next morning with hangover memory the night before and godly powers ,1
 homebrew setting the primary lawful evil deity named for friend lewie essentially has three domains tyranny law applied without mercy vengeance and community the idea being that cruel and harsh god but also recognizes that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar thus his church often the most benevolent toward the common people day day basis the running gag that lewian churches sponsor more inner city basketball teams than any other major faith you probably want change the name but might make interesting dynamic within your setting ,-1

 like the idea prometheus giving magic the pcs however think that prometheus should more like demi god and that the reason why gives the magic mortals prometheus could jealous the fact that the gods have all the powers and they granted him only half status upon his creation thus his revenge giving humanity order turn the tides power among deities and mortals furthermore perhaps the repercussion prometheus feels from his action being dragged the underworld cerberus making him seem less than deity like and more mortal inhuman order face judgment from egyptian goddess morals virtue and judge the dead ,1

zen master bassui said when the functioning analytical consciousness destroyed feelings are purified this referred the pure land the west you truly want know the meaning being born the pure land you must first know the master who born this land the physical body has never from its inception been the true body but rather temporary formation the five aggregates after the four elements disperse what remains called the self the self originally empty what that born the pure land there master born the pure land what that seeks this land bliss just extinguish the ever seeking mind rid thoughts and attachment form and the body consisting the four elements will have individual self when there individual mind the nature mind and there aspect disorder ,1
pure land other power opposed the usual self power taught most buddhist schools though the pure land here and now and not some other dimension the afterlife ,1
there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,1
 going try comment this simply can gets metaphysical and some may even say supernatural but hope you can try maintain open mind enough for help with your understanding everything that physical everything that exists the universe and beyond are created the power the mind exercised through consciousness mara created the samsara worlds planes dimensions that may experience joy sadness love heartbreaks etc this was done through his her its focus the mind and streams consciousness began attracted these worlds planes dimensions and begin develop craving for existence and thus begins the cycle rebirth the pure lands buddhism were created the focus the mind amitabha buddha way help individuals attain enlightenment their own pace amitabha buddha understood that the attraction emotions sex love and existence can overwhelming for normal individuals overcome within one lifetime 100 years average for human beings other beings much shorter and yet others much longer created the pure lands the west place refuge and practice for those who call upon his name sincerely this place not metaphorical state mind while these individuals are earth for lack better word real though not necessarily physical the way feel physical things via the electromagnetic repelling force electrons this world certain laws physics are applicable that world land plane dimension whatchamacallit certain laws physics not apply and yet newer laws superphysics would also the rule there that not the law our world now having been carried this land doesn mean that the individuals are guaranteed enlightenment first they still need cultivate themselves while there enlightenment not given dependant every single individual consciousness efforts shed the fetters samsara anger ignorance and jealousy and embrace the noble truths they may choose rejoin the samsaric worlds again and back into the cycle rebirth but least they have the option stay and cultivate themselves the pure land the west that would the main difference between the abrahamic idea heaven against the amitabha buddha pure lands the west hope this helps ,1
 think your characterization pure land isn that far off there reason not that popular among westerners odd abandon christianity judaism and take pure land because first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma but now seems much leap faith the abrahamic religions least the pure land sect most forms buddhism have some sort supernatural element some orthodox believers might deny that just like some christians might attempt make scientific arguments for the world being 6000 years old the very least you have rebirth and different planes that includes devas zen seems have the least reverence for dogma which why popular the west the other western strategy assume things are meaningful figuratively and not literally but yeah buddhism religion the end the day for most its followers ,1
most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1
you won find one answer your question but the pure land state mind perspective reality not separate place let quote thich nhat hanh human beings our deepest desire find environment which secure and where there love and understanding all want live such environment you live surroundings where you feel there security understanding and love and where people have the capacity transform their suffering fear and attachment then you live the pure land from finding our true home this isn leap faith all because you have already been the pure land but momentarily every time you bring the buddha mind fully then you are said the pure land imagine because you enter that state some degree this not matter faith but expanding upon what you know joyful experience quite different the abrahamic religions concept heaven which eschatological reality rather than gnostic one will add that there course are some who believe the pure land totally separate paradise however there are positive ways understanding this when the state mind another rebirth will seem like such foreign reality that may well different place entirely ,1
 first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma isn good thing about buddhism least for outsider that much easier pick and choose what parts you not want use see dogma kind environment habitat for the profound and useful ideas develop all religions have something useful buddhist religions and not just one homogeneous buddhism just seem have something that more relevant and powerful the context our culture ,1
from limited knowledge the pure land not paradise but place contemplation stepping off point where you are given the knowledge leave the cycle suffering and rebirth anything more akin the now defunct catholic idea purgatory than actual heaven ,1
 response your question about how amitabha created the pure land this quote from the article pure land buddhism wikipedia the longer sukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha s≈´tra the buddha begins describing his attendant ƒÅnanda past life the buddha amitƒÅbha states that past life amitƒÅbha was once king who renounced his kingdom and became bodhisattva monk named dharmƒÅkara dharma storehouse under the guidance the buddha loke≈õvararƒÅja world sovereign king innumerable buddha lands throughout the ten directions were revealed him after meditating for five eons bodhisattva then made great series vows save all sentient beings and through his great merit created the realm sukhƒÅvatƒ´ ultimate bliss this land sukhƒÅvatƒ´ would later come known the pure land chinese translation important remember that buddhism has been around for thousands years and that for long time buddhists didn have telescopes big machines scan the brain with his holiness the dalai lama himself has said that the discoveries science and the teachings buddhism contradict then the discoveries science are correct this video tgv1gwvrz one the major teachings the buddha was test out each his teachings oneself order see they were true rather than taking his word faith without proof however course just man who has seen mountain some remote region where one has not traveled may believed until the distance that region crossed might have some sort faith buddhist teachings since the people doing the teachings have often devoted their whole lives the teachings the buddha ,1

the discussion about the rat ended concluding won work because you will naturally headbutt the rat death minotaur might work with another race though trog wrath very very very difficult survive you have boots levitation and lots food you might able hover over lava deep water won help summons giant sized creatures other than that tomb card might work you have your stash food not sure you not using shield you might well switch two handed axe from experience anti magic isn that great with brand fire you can generally kill things faster use holy versus liches and other undead casters and also kill them faster ,1
 could swear they lowered trog wrath just got extremely lucky because recently tried make the switch kobe and was not difficult all just took food ring and some perma food and carved out two space area near the the summons were actually not the worst part the worst got was berserk hill giant and the vast majority were just berserk bears for the worst part was actually the rotting since happened least times and never caught right away while spamming rest,-1
for the love gods don the abyss until trog wrath over none your teleport blink panic buttons work lost handful very promising mibes this way ,1
 when and how supposed swap tso and branch order from there basically you switch immediately before entering crypt clear crypt max tso piety then holy brand your best weapon your case that executioners axe and off you post endgame branch order like whatever theres strict order like there the early game whichever branch you feel best prepared for how avoid meeting terrible fate the hands trog wrath you have book with blink soon you leave trog train transloc little bit that you can cast then whenever surrounds you with berserking enemies you can blink out the middle them and run staircase teleport you can keep scrolls blinking hand for this purpose but feel more secure also having the spell trog wrath includes fire miscasts that burn all your shit see trick with going lair and having rat block you off but this still viable you can the rat shield thing with most combos but its tedious and unnecessary and your case the minotaur retaliatory headbutt would kill the rat anyway its not option antimagic axe that carry around viable for use all since strictly one handed should train shields use with since have shield reflection could use not really war axes arent very good and while has fantastic selection resists does little damage that its not practical choice weapon against any tough monster wouldnt forgo the damage output weapon use physical shield shields arent very good for melee allruners and therse always tsos divine shield ability you want reflection isnt good shield brand plus its double not good for tso worshiper you reflect poison projectile and hits something you will incur penance for use poison ,1
 brother trog very wrathful indeed but his will destroy you neither endless nor inevitable going take the route many will find the easy way out and say that getting past trog your level trivial his wrath dangerous out the open but when you are able choose the area diluted mere timesink what you must grab your closest disintegration wand and cut two diagnols into the wall this will allow you only view one other tile time this point you simply need make sure you have good chunks permafood pip two and then either drop your scrolls wear conservation that point you just spam rest and then tab every time trog has tantrum minotaur your power should have trouble killing his summons after long while you will get message saying has calmed down then you are free worship that damned tso trog wrath your level probably one the least dangerous things you can spend your time dealing with you are willing cheese ,1
 were you slime zot except for the orb chamber and blade hopefully you find some better armour you really want good executioner axe before you convert well the okay but could better you really need wearing plate gda something heavier you have more than abandoned trog with level mibe and found pretty trivial the berserked stone giants weren terribly difficult and cleared tomb and most all hells while under trog wrath but somewhat wary trying this with your low and weak weapon you could try waiting out but takes thousands and thousands turns very boring one handed axes suck use executioner axe ,1
 have currently rune mibe right now and abandoned trog then immediately cleared crypt max piety and enchant executioner axe then threw caution the winds and cleared pan and hells while under trog wrath was tricky but doable make sure you have curing potions that time was strong enough take out trog summons all sides problem worked but could have died with worse luck ,1
 your stage you should strong enough take the berserk summons have the resources escape out them retreat corridor and take them one one quaff curing heal rot would also recommend you get plate armour better asap for the and guaranteed damage reduction also wield the biggest axes you can find kill things faster ,1
 you max armour dodging and shields for tso divine shield then the berserkers are joke can wipe them even when fully surrounded and only lose health even with armour and dodging they won give you much trouble ,-1
ewwww why are you using broad axe get real weapon bet trog gave you good battleaxe exec axe something splint get plate armour better trog wrath will completely destroy char with such poor defenses ,1

 course yes sir you are right should vote the current government back into power because they clearly more than one man ,1
nonsense who claimed that the panacea for all evils will turn india into supapowaaa 2015 find one poster who claimed such here almost everyone acknowledges that the best atleast one the best amongst the current available lot and can provide governance that will atleast better relative the current upa regime ,1
yes won solve all the problems overnight but strong leader with plan still better than idiots with plan case study obama people expected the economy fixed the thursday after was elected and course that didn happen still fairly shit and most the issues that were big deal 2009 are still pertaining but still did manage eliminated subsidies private lender middlemen student loans and protect student borrowers healthcare reforms for tens millions americans expanded hate crime law the include sexual orientation appointed nations first chief technology officer signed financial reform law establishing consumer financial protection bureau signed financial reform law prohibiting banks from engaging proprietary trading are these irrelevant and pointless they aren hasn lifted america out the sewer but empowered students women consumers medical patients etc that they can achieve their potential without shit like insurance and loans get their way thus bringing back point the change you wantt see etc etc and that what believe modi can the change for the country must come from the grass roots easier said than done not like have deal with lapse enforement laws corruption red tape logistics etc you can call modi bots but think the alternatives double failure mms rahul gandhi digvijay chiddu what has the congress done besides spoonfeed the backward zombies and keep them backward ,-1
please change the title wretched country where its news sold appease the ruling party wretched country where terrorism sickularism maoism separatism tolerated wretched country whose leaders appease community the name religion and caste wretched country where its leaders are involved corruption scams rape money laundering tax evasion etc not saying namo will solve all problems but atleast will not remain mute and deaf like manmohan singh who does not even give interviews about his governance atleast namo speaks good bad about his state manmohan singh does not not even speak about the country just lapdog sonia gandhi ,1
and even more wretched the country that can depend even one man there have been people throughout history who were pivotal figures gandhi and lincoln are two examples have seen modi handle his charge that gujarat superbly contrast have seen politicians who are inept and corrupt led the congress which can sell out the country for example pitting against cbi and having suggestions surface that pakistan sponsored attack admitted pakistan was inside job yes bank the man hope nothing happens him because our opinion party that capable compromising india interests vis vis pakistan capable killing someone well ,1

looking modi from outside seems similar popularity what obama was here when was running for elections both seem different from rest the field both attract huge number followers ideas both are fresh and both give people their countries hope that previous politicians had all but removed obama good president opinion but isnt good was saying will and that probably because political restraints under expect the same happen with modi seems have done lot good for gujarat but not sure can that level good for entire india both obama and modi are very eloquent orators ,1

lets say modi has attributes abcxyz people who like him like him for abcx people who don like him and despise him lot for cxyz that people who like him like him for different reasons than the reasons for which people hate him this why the whole confusion and cacophony opinions when person who trying understand the landscape modi has huge popularity among nris and india which don really understand why his abc characteristics for which liked much his supporters are his economic and growth policies and his pro hindutva ala pat robertson bill reilly style christian conservatism political stance his xyz characteristics for which hated much his opponents his association with gujarat riots during 2002 his state suffered through terrible riots between hindus and muslims triggered train full hindu pilgrims allegedly burned muslim mob resulted state wide backlash against muslims and about 1000 muslims died and many many more were displaced india has had his own share riots and usually the ruling leaders aren blamed much but narendra modi hated much because came television and sympathized with the hindu rioters addition there were reports him letting happen despite the controversy over the years modi has enjoyed widespread support his state and won many elections terms personality wise outspoken and has all the leaderish not leadership qualities indians desire their leader this year election could quite like 2012 american election where lot more people voted against mitt romney and republicans rather than voted for obama although congress government isn popular bjp runs with polarizing figure like modi then there will people flocking congress government but this does not predict the outcome the election hope that helps ,1
 been following reddit for while mainly because how entertaining and sometimes informative the comments various issues are been thinking joining for while and bit the bullet after seeing this thread what has modi done candidate what the gujarat story his many enemies will typically quote various statistics show his state poor light but the problem with statistics they can quoted out context reach the conclusion you want according your agenda gujarat means the most developed state india and does indeed lag behind many social indicators but the fact was doing far worse most these child malnutrition before modi became and speaking indicators rarely will your see article highlighting that gujarat contributes percent india industrial output and percent its exports gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate for indian state and accounts for percent new job creation gujarat has 100 percent rural electrification with power supply over 000 villages which has been boon not only for small scale industries but also farmers gujarat has agricultural sector growth percent against the national average percent gujarat known for great road network connecting the above 000 villages well well managed public transportation system gujarat known for relatively low corruption levels and higher efficiency police and government this has been helped governance and policing initiatives general getting things done much faster gujarat than the average for indian governments tata got its nano plant approved matter days rather than months years complaints about roads infrastructure etc are generally dealt with quickly there more but this should for start and typing out this much gleaned from various online and gujarati sources some reddit itself afraid already established myself moditard and will probably the immediate target all manner criticism ,1
truth told there not insignificant percentage the middle class who are willing vote for modi order avoid voting for congress corruption rahul gandhi but the modi tards are not making this easy decision should ,1

shortest answer that the ruling party the left side the political spectrum and has gone over the top appeasing poor people different religions and distributing free stuff modi leans the right and more free market kind guy and believes more the western sense secularism and wants uniform civil code one big blot his career which the opposition milking like desparados the 2002 riot during which happened the gujarat that another variable the equation ,1
 you come the wrong place ask about modi this place full ultra right wing hindu neonazis asking here about modi like asking westboro baptist church about religious tolerance you should probably read about him online from independent media sources ,1

when was around supported congress because thought the current gandhis were mahatma gandhis offsprings then read about gandhi and started hating him and thus turn congress then read about the current gandhis and started hating them little bit more then read about the gandhis and their government over here and now ill never vote for them between bjp and congress bjp lot better theres doubt that they will indulge corruption that given but the scale will lot lower than that congress moreover theyll actually get some work done ,1

 was pro congress long time ago long time before joined reddit and now completely pro bjp stance has grown even stronger after all the discussion here itt people who are ignorant about politics and dislike inspite the fact that their future and future india depends one piece advise for all those who show apathy towards politics either get interested now you would end choosing the wrong ones who keep screwing you and the country also you are least interested note this point well state elections you can vote for regional parties but never vote for regional parties loksabha elections for 2014 you have just options bjp congress you still have time make your mind for either them all those expecting third front dont please dont they would turn out larger looters than the congress such government ever forms for all the aap supporters you can vote for them delhi you wish and its your right vote for whoever you wish but loksabha elections dont vote for aap already existence plenty regional parties making mess parliamentary decision making dont make worse ,-1
 have actually seen lot users views change during the course stay india from being neutral pro congress anti congress when joined reddit there were like two right wingers india sniper and damonex guess that was the time rise right wingers all over the internet ,1
 flick the switch towards modi thank the high decibel campaign the congress and stooges letting know all the things that modi did not sure which side the congress the media they seem campaign for modi and reminds cho ramaswamy could someone else too comment about the dmk loss the last election they gave out freebies like free and discounted cable connections lots people that very same thing boomeranged against the dmk showing the dmk corruption scam and other money grubbing activities the dmk larger audience with the free tvs and cable connections done the very tools that they were using bribe voters self goal ,1
not india such but conversations with north east friends who tell about the horrors congress rule refugees appeasement and that didn sit down well with regarding bjp was pro bjp during vajapayee but 2003 obviously helped shake that confidence only after years kind figured that there deeper game play looking the amount propoganda newspapers went voice their hate against modi wasn just right and yeah sickularism have had talk with folks who have problem with modi and they are entitled their opinion some the information they have which they use build their opinion selective and flawed but then some the information know might well flawed too everything war now are age information warfare more the information more tough shove away the and know the truth the human mind can only take much ,-1
" before used anti rss result anti bjp very skeptical towards aap thought jlp bill was silly drama used lean lot towards left but was not impressed their presence national stage thought other 3rd front parties are over ambitious clowns supported congress they appeared the best available option they are definitely not perfect but better than other options however must admit like most their purported aam admi initiatives you know the which will feed lazy people now still dislike rss vhp their ideology bjp fan boys their rabid bigotry scares don think modi evil too but very skeptical that would able control his masters fans sangha parviar cronies aap not bad very impressed how transparent they have kept their finances for that reason alone wish they will win elections delhi nothing has changed about left other 3rd front but then again you barely hear about them online anyway things seem would still with inc the best available option for the lok sabha

 tell people from gujarat people who been there what gujarat like just like any other good state india good urban centres and average poor rural areas are there broken roads there yes you people get clean drinking water and other facilities yes and people have access drinking water their premises according planning commission data 2011 clean drinking water treated drinking water like anywhere india completely like the usa terms infrastructure and civic amenities lol there still miles before you even remotely touch that level ,1
 been ahmedabad gandhinagar sometime 2005 and the roads there are high quality and they must the usual counter call this that capital city they take more care roads are automatically renewed etc live hyderabad and proof otherwise also like madhu kishwar wrote her manushi blog people have peaceful and safe social outing even after 10pm etc which relatively unthinkable hyderabad the cops themselves might give people washing and send home ,1
not much they would like you believe but still one the best states india live there are broken roads there still poverty lack clean drinking water issue the people are really friendly and nice fun state and the prohibition alcohol has done wonders the civic life have been gujarat for over years now and have loved every moment except for the fact that isn very accommodating meat lovers come and visit the state sometime the gir national park rann kutch especially during the rannmahotsav daman and diu somnath and many other places visit ,1

from someone who has been gujarat while travelling various places some years back still remember the clean lane highways windmills everywhere the both sides the roads and the scenic beauty top that development total coherence with nature preservation was just small naive boy then though your dismay and mine those windmills and solar cell arrays are still hold rajasthan iirc the state things hopeless with the increasing thefts inox wind 150 crore the authorities don give fuck except looking for their cut and the private companies say they can install the machinery with these thefts going and its 2013 now compare that with gujarat also someone can confirm have heard from friends that any govt official doesn see your queries complaints within specific period time you can directly approach the modi its that simple try contacting mayawati ,1
yes has used live vastrapur which was considered lower middle class middle class area the vastrapur lake was developed front eyes changing the entire socio economic fabric that place within years also the will second rbecks visited friends village very small blink and you miss place near himmatnagar and the roads were lanes speaking people the village they told because the roads they could get their produce the cities themselves instead hiring 3rd party transporters have stayed many cities over life time delhi mumbai bangalore gujarat and comparing them all over one life time the changes are surprisingly drastic and saying that development happening all over india does not cut majority this development happening urban areas only but gujarat you can see happening both urban and rural areas,1

the clearly sarcastic and malignant posting this obviously very modest and holier than thou aap supporter ,1
 not all there reason why modi known feku popularly everywhere now doubt has done some good work gujarat but that only from more marketing perspective rather then any good value the people kankariya lake ahemdabad very well known face changed now completely looks like any international location but now common man cant there why because entry fee kankaria lake inr know inr not big deal but once lake which was open public now costing inr just enter highways and roads connecting village best but roads villages and cities are having tons holes industrialization has gone crazy there regulation come from kutch and have seen things really mad there terms pollution there proper guideline implemented terms what should height chimney mills chimney mills are low that when you even walk your home your feet will get black pollution villages are unbearable villages still runs most public transport not petrol diesel but fucking kerosene education definitely improving but you wont see much difference compared years consumption tobacco would highest gujarat gujarat govt corrupt like any other state govt company was bidding for project gujarat were told pay lacs for tender and tender will your favour but still cant give guarantee tomorrow someone else comes with better amount will ditch you your face narmada damn very good example modi doing good work really great work its benefits are tremendous but the way modi portraying progress gujarat just cream but ground reality worst then you can imagine ,1

 don count congress out yet they may form government delhi tomorrow will know how much social media impacts elections bjp didn had strong candidate delhi despite aap bjp gets majority will think that only because modi regardless that modi has very tough road ahead congress looses delhi and other states will see very nasty campaign 2014 would love see how muslim majority government employee majority and rich upper middle class area vote share and comparison with 2008 one gets majority who you think aap will support aap will take support from form government ,-1
well the guys below the original active participation politics started with development agenda modi and iac movement regarding this anti corruption middle class etc this aap party not the first india happened earlier during jayaprakash narayan era and his chela mulayam singh was arvind kejriwal that time the second time happened during singh era its simply matter time and enjoy how history repeats ,1
the very fact that the delhi elections are discussed india far more often than the elections the other states indicates that aap having great impact democracy india were not for aap vast majority would not care about these elections the major political parties india have always been cahoots and indian elections have had almost impact the lives most its citizens regardless how many seats aap wins hope all realize that this the first time grassroots organization built volunteers and without any kind corporate backing can have great impact indian elections ,1

what were the other policies you discussed not asking for details you gave above just bullet points thx ,-1
 thought would not understand policy discussions but what you have listed simple good way summarize increase oil production guess that should easy since saw recently that leaders all parties unanimously support this initiative for nominal amount really need this for inclusive development but guess this would need the support state governments too have really retarded regional parties ruling promising states congress has totally failed this aspect hope bjp could turn things around definitely agree especially are way behind electronics market many semiconductor companies have huge non manufacturing sites here iirc intel was supposed usher semiconductor manufacturing early 2005 and they pulled out because these lethargic policy makers not beat dead horse but wish bjp and all parties become serious tackling the silent corruption government especially the regulatory and enforcement boards like law and order environment water totally screwed one family members high ranking official one such board doesn matter which government has been transferred incessantly recently got transferred when got into tussle with opposition party mla industry and the ruling party minister summoned him next week and handed the transfer and top all not even honest does the least that could and that follows court orders god bless the honest officers hope this would change maybe the political discourse that happening among people nowadays will change ,1
nice know that thank you ,1
its because bjp wants such rules place and its better get done under congress they won get blamed that way ,1
" india has been ruined congress and populist schemes the problem with populist schemes that you can make noise you are opposition you instantly branded anti poor another problems once introduced not easy get rid them aap with share leftists and socialist like prashant bhushan yogendra yadav binayak sen etc are more towards congress ideology with added agenda anti corruption compared bjp want see some pro market reforms which will create jobs and get our country
back growth rate another problem have the minority appeasement meeting tauqueer raza and then going defend him aap doing the same things
that congress did third holier than thou attitude they just don accept that there are good non corrupt people all parties lot people from
congress and bjp joined aap and suddenly became non corrupt while they were corrupt their old parties don hate aap don like their ideology and attitude would even vote there was option aap like party with right leaning
economic ideology afaik loksatta one such party but even though stay hyd don have vote here have vote native state ",-1
long rant from aap supporter answers for all your questions you think that aap the only honest party and arvind some kind messiah arvind says that gadkari corrrupt that you will start running around with pitchforks and torches but ignore the news when gadkari proven innocent arvind says that bjp congress you aaptards being intellectually lazy will just accept gospel truth without asking why are raman singh jaitley shivraj vasundhra modi goa corrupt infact they are some the most honest intelligent and progress driven politicians india since very long time unlike aap bjp actually takes action against part members who act retarded case point jethmalani jaswant reddy kesubhai and many others compare that aap one founding members bhushan hardcore anti nationalist shazia caught accepting bribes even before election action against them defectors are given tickets arvind himself plays mulla appeasing policies numerous times aap just bunch idealist lefties who keep shouting the loudest that all politicians are thieves people being stupid accept the generalising statement and convert aaptards without checking the truth still don necessarily hate aap just think that bjp much better option also that most aap fanbois are just fanbois who can think thing themselves added later also point about aap fans being retards proven the downvote campaign which the resident aaptards downvote all comments after every such post proves point that aaptards are just bunch intellectually empty fanbois even the seems naive with his silly questions ,1
every question yours loaded how you expect objective discussion ,0
because aapturds eat poop then they poop and they use write false promises that why they are called aapturds,-1

 politics part the unholy duo religion politics which brings out some the most emotional and impassioned read holds barred slug flamewars the web expect people argue beyond region and logic ,1
 have said time and again most people arent shallow minded like the aaptards think vote single agendas agendas which they know unrealistic and just are plain rhetoric dont blame for not having the tunnel vision that you lot are afflicted with corruption does not mean effective governance rather live corrupt nation but one that provides relatively better governance than honest state that just stagnates you didnt understand what said the previous para that exactly the problem with aaptards and you need expand your political perspective ,1
aap the new congress congress issues certificates secularism aap issues honesty anybody who comes from any party and joins congress becomes insta secular similarly all the odd mlas who went from bjp cong aap because they were rejects their own party have become insta honest way just like cong the gangotri indian secularism aap the yamnotri honesty ,1
thanks for proving once again that aap supporters are bunch immature bholas having deep rooted casteist and communal views this why easy for congress make fools out you they split their opposition vote and made delhi ungovernable and you stupids fell for their game plan and still haven wisened hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa troll ,1
problem with aap they are like worker union leaders sure they have honest intentions but then again not sure good union leaders would make good mds maybe wrong here but how much will ways aap survive reality still unknown even maharashtra prithviraj chavan was almost forced resign when exposed ajit pawars corruption even helpless what can you expect from others corruption like vicious network intertwined and ingrained into indian society should focus changing society unlike aap dudes who think bringing some law going improve things practically speaking bjp right choice about aap nothing can said how can perform national level ,1

great appreciate your efforts and this healthy way debate and criticise opponents not the kind which involves baseless lies rumors and team foreign funding crap tired those now which for some reason bjp followers think more effectice don know who told them that because only pisses off and more damage than good bjp itself and since you mentioned your post and made clear our discussion that corruption the issue for will track this post and engage ina discussion once you address that point because matter what good policy you come with unless you can implement the ground they mean nothing and this why before anything want corruption addressed share with how modi planning fight corruption ,1
 hate aap for the other thread points such the routine flip plops appeasement ology positions stated about batla house etc this particularly because aap proclaims basic that others are not sum aap self advertised image and platform their commentary why they have not yet perform nothing about ,-1

 perhaps they fear they may lose small fraction voter base they either support oppose hopefully they will come with their views soon what think the problem that many individual party members may have personal opinion but they don want say anything against the party lines this just personal view party traditionally with right center views and the fact that they are mum about the supreme court having reverted the decision made the delhi high court fear they agree with but hope they take stance soon not having opinion all the worst stance for any political party especially issues relating human rights 377 homosexuality any other especially when party has strong candidate running for ,-1
 critical issue nice priorities bro for the record fully endorse the repealing the archaic law which needlessly protrudes into the bedrooms consenting adults but dont get carried away except tiny tiny minority urban centers one gives shit this issue ,-1
 the only problem will take years show its effects society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit ‚Äù the fact that the bjp manifesto which honestly could just bunch populist bullshit promotes long range initiatives reason itself optimistic about bjp led future years isn that long reality but the mind indian politician parliament election cycles ,1
 really have very little issue with bjp economic policies think they have the clearest agenda among big parties more concerned with the social aspects their agenda they also are doing terrible job the opposition and are known pretty corrupt ,-1
 like bjp should put this their manifestos anyway least the middle class and the business community will find attractive please continue you have more one suggestion read trade magazine some time ago about how employees maruti factory were striking for wages the tune whopping lakh illustrated how our labor laws had driven salaries unsustainably high many manufacturing sectors and stymied india efforts become manufacturing hub how even bangladesh was having more success than this regard fact this why many indian manufacturers seem hire disproportionately high percentage contract labourers work their factories they don have pay them the same high rates from this would say labor reform and reducing the power unions something else that needs considered the hidden policies that are wait ,1
 really hope focuses more rooftop solar ece like germany not just gujarat but the entire country much good skip hydrocarbon and straightaway adopt renewables that will have adopt anyways the future ,1
well who actually reads the manifesto ,0
why should bjp say anything there law has amended scrapped the government can introduce the new law parliament and depending the new law bjp can choose support not the problem posted the other thread day back most people are misunderstanding that the article 377 against homosexuals covers wide range issues and the foundation for other laws also makes lot heterosexual acts unlawful including general terms blowjob and anal sex you read and understand the entirety the law then you will understand that doesn mention homosexuals and applied against them should the law scrapped sure but before that see that since this the only law that covers sodomy guess india will also need laws covering rape male female another male also not sure the new rape laws 2013 protect male child not coz they not then this the only law per understanding which can use punish the criminal law not against homosexuals applied against them can applied against heterosexuals also scrap but create new laws first replace this law someone from the legal fraternity can ama and answer our questions about article 377 and rape abuse laws india will great clearing the misinformation ,1
politically would stupid move take stand right before the elections maybe that the reason,-1
 would like bjp come out support scrapping sec 377 but won expect them make comment this because there are lot religious organizations which are against scrapping 377 and support bjp there might loss support bjp takes stance this close national elections might not work well bjp does not have presence many states would not like alienate whatever support has other parts meenakshi lekhi pointed out her tweets this ruling doesn make any difference the act between consenting adults neither them will file fir police won come checking around your bedroom see what you are upto just that will illegal act eyes law congress the other hand has come support scrapping this law openly this spite asg arguing for the law guess congress knows won forming the next government any stand takes issues won hurt them much ,-1
the government should have say what goes between two consenting adults room period why the hell are you bothered about his stance lgbt rights just because that moron sanjay jha raised the issue ,-1
politics 101 country that medieval minded the one hand and seeks 21st century capitalistic interests the other ,-1
let put forward some problems and issues the first problem solved define sodomy and what acts are included presently blowjobs anal sex etc are illegal for everyone the major question arises whether allow fucking the assholes yes then should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well lesbians having sex fine until they are not really penetrating anything you would wonder then how could called sex but they wish use sex toys for the same they are not allowed owning selling producing sex toys banned india sex toys are allowed india again the question arises should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well even the act sex needs defined the present definition wont stand the point does not affect single law affects plenty laws commenting the issue would mean lot things and believe unless someone has clear idea what other effects that might have the existing laws she should refrain from commenting its good supporting opposing something but doing without knowledge inappropriate ,1
critical issue lol one cares ,1
this would issue these people were prosecuted under 377 and thrown jail tbn and9gctljwbsdyreogwxjxqaeakwn eauxr95fn6ylsdimxltrmsi3lh jpg jpg pride15 jpg agree that the article joke which also criminalizes heterosexual oral anal sex however practice person only charged one the individual not adult the act committed without consent yeah archaic law that needs but doesn harm anybody hence political party stance the issue irrelevant ,-1

from another thread want ask how can someone who will purportedly run clean political party start his career with lies committing character assassinations honest people and not apologizing when the accusations not amount anything then there the matter persistent muslim appeasement style politics claiming batla house encounter was fake then when people tried pin him down doing volte face and saying that agreed with the court judgement the point note that the judgement had been out for months when the offending aap pamphlet came out approaching the muslim electorate not citizens but flock who can pimped out sundry maulanas like taqeer raza taqeer raza has been indicted for giving out fatwa behead tasleema nasreen yet when asked kejri brazened out saying let someone produce proof that taqeer raza issued fatwa when there are cases against him running courts for this very thing also the volte faces are far too frequent some gent writing for indian exponent criticized economic vision document aap website link below today that document gone from aap website there stand that aap will not give will not play well the mediia what can trust them for aam aadmi party aap economic vision been disappointment far html then there are previous baseless allegations aap went town claiming that bjp candidates have criminal cases against them when the reality that almost all cases are for crimes like unlawful assembly these are the exact kind cases that kejriwal and many aap candidates themselves are facing given that bjp was the principal opposition the capital for the past years its natural that most such cases for public protests will against the bjp candidates how can you trust the allegations coming out his mouth when willing indulge such cheap tactics please dont think that saying these things bjp supporter was vocal supporter the iac movement going the extent taking half day leave and joining protest the now feel cheated that kejriwal has used the support well meaning people like launch himself career active politics which neither intellectually nor ethically equipped handle any case not trying tell you whom support but former iac supporter want say that dont find aap politics any different from any other political party ,1
 you have provided options aap haters per your tiny winy kuchhi pucchi chhotu motu understanding indian politics with all due respect may ask for provision nota ,-1
" like aap for its stand corruption and making people aware about their civic duties and mobilizing youth take part active politics hate aap for its communist ideology public appeasement policies minority appeasement which are not very different from congress and for its arrogant and holier than thou attitude
they have build party showing negative points others its high time they show good governance forming government delhi and prove themselves fulfilling tall claims they have made ",-1
 are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party think this illustrates why people hate the followers aap with vengeance much fucking smug stupid that they can power thousand suns which have died down and turned into barren stars edit also this thread posted nri muslim nri muslim lethal combo ,-1
and let not forget most the aap are kinda naive believing that once these folks get power their problems will fixed the shitty truth won and can the way they would want edit but respect them for shaking things ,1
 why you hate other parties apart from aap how does khujli dick taste are you corrupt mind have you benefited through corruption you blindly support some other party you support some party because your caste religion brahmins bjp and muslims congress you don believe corruption can eradicated indian politics ,-1
your questions are absolutely ridiculous and shows how out touch with reality you are the world not all black and white just because someone votes for support particular party doesn mean they hate the others definitely don hate aap don like their solutions problems and don care for their style politics don see how anyone can logically expect adding more bureaucracy lokpal solve the problem corruption that was created too much bureaucracy begin with similarly their election promises free water and cheap electricity everyone what one the richest cities the country backward step when should moving away from govt subsidies for everyone all means support the poorest the poor with all the subsidies the world but there reason why the govt should lose money powering the air conditioned bungalows the super rich delhi the poor barely have any electric appliances this country the only way they are going able pay for such subsidies increasing tax revenues which will primarily impact businesses negatively and the domino effect will affect job creation etc aap anti capitalist tilt pretty evident anyone who isn totally blinded their anti corruption talk just because they claim have good moral stand corruption doesn mean should blindly trust them with all aspects governance clearly lot people delhi not agree with and that perfectly fine they are entitled their opinions and choices just like entitled mine ,1
 many assumptions man just many least try possible neutral and unbiased you going for discussion ,1
 dont hate aap but your questions are example why disagree with their style politics your mind people who disagree with aap hate aap they are blind supporters some other party are corrupt caste ist there room for disagreement with aap and still honest upright citizen who wants good things for his country this extremism one the reasons why dislike the aap ,-1
 always hated self righteous morons ,-1
what hate about aaptards they mentally convinced themself that kejriwal the only option any other argument met with vehement resistance anti corruption rhetoric and personal attacks both myself and the party person defend can abide naked hypocrites self denial people who like hide from things they don want see and hear the last couple days heard kejriturd compare atal behari vajpayee scamohan singh also heard response modi honesty sound economic policies consisting nothing but anti corruption rhetoric the age old 2002 riots propaganda simply absolute silence and finally complete lack awareness interest the political realities scenarios aside from bjp congress bhai bhai lokpal swaraj kejriwal will save some deeply flawed and full holes way ,-1
 aap supporter but stop this with against bullshit ,0
why can disagree with aap policies without agreeing the reasons you have provided this ploy many who wants label somebody anti something for example you don temples you athiest you not hindu etc etc the simplest all reasons that self righteousness and pragmatism cannot mixed sometimes you will have take decisions that are unpopular against well established principles keeping mind future benefit and common good you cannot flexible such situations you are not doing any good administrator politician ,1
 bakchodi leaking again ,0
 corruption just matter legality financial irregularity and bribery the currency social transaction egregiously unequal society which power continues concentrated the hands smaller and smaller minority imagine for example city shopping malls whose streets hawking has been banned hawker pays the local beat cop and the man from the municipality small bribe break the law and sell her wares those who cannot afford the prices the malls that such terrible thing future will she have pay the lokpal representative too does the solution the problems faced ordinary people lie addressing the structural inequality creating yet another power structure that people will have defer you and your chutiyaapa,-1
 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,1
 don hate aap but doubt their intentions ,-1

 just small party with noble goals their ideology seems bit muddled and bit too idealistic lots parties start out like this lot things their initial manifesto seemed very poorly thought out maybe that has changed but ultimately just like every other election there will mostly hung parliament and leadership will decided horse trading with shifty state level parties mamata jayalalitha mulayam singh cpm karunanidhi etc etc this one the things that holds progress back frankly whether bjp aap bjp power the country will the shitter really wonder how people think otherwise just look the last years after independance people really think regime change has huge effect anything for example home state west bengal had regime change the party tmc came power with huge promises barely see any difference honest think both the cpm and tmc are awful when power changes hands move from set thugs another not really strongly pro any party highly doubt any party will easily fix corruption india generally very jingoistic very young and strongly influenced peer groups facebook twitter media lot people here are right leaning and pro hinduism very small community and not really the kind place where you will find ton debate topics like this will generally very polarized generally don discuss politics with people since just reflection their adherence group think ,1

this very good stuff thank you for taking the time post here all the points you raised and the discussion points this thread have with government investment know this necessary but not the full picture there needs very strong emphasis removing excessive laws and regulation take your point raising revenues for the government you have listed five but there unthinkably large number activities people could only starting and running businesses didn involve interacting government officials second third tier towns the government can just provide basic services roads water internet millions small business owners could relocate out choked cities and spur local growth the opportunities are endless consider the city mysore under the classification the five would pretty much fall squarely under tourism but the government could give better power more reliable communications and better roads bangalore could very easily transformed into hub the revenues that come out the ecosystem will far exceed any the original five categories ,1
 see aap followers are conspicuous their abscence here the ideas seen here make you uncomfortable don want reminded kerjiwal non existent plans for economic revival and repairing the damage wrought the upa don like hearing good solutions that the aap can provide ,1
 this because import our oil needs and produce just and trade deficit makes matters worse depreciates the value rupee yeah only partly what about the indian oil prospecting companies that are allowed sell indian drilled oil indians international rates there are huge profit margins the wells reliance and vedanta this national resource that few people are being allowed profit from ,-1
exactly the reason don want aap ruin bjp chances supported aap only for delhi elections but now seems like they are driving confidence without proving how effective they are delhi bjp might have many corrupt politicians but overall has been more development pro than any other political party india can all write letter aap requesting them run delhi efficiently for years instead focussing this time ,1

for political party coming out nowhere not totally true but look their competition and completing their first anniversary only recently even they win seat will huge win for indians like who hope for better india who left better career prospects abroad stay india and something about the state affairs here the india which gandhi and patel and maulana and nehru and ambedkar and prasad and lalaji and gokhale and many others dreamt which kalam dreams which every citizen dreams the meantime you can cry some more ,1
 seems that they are taking congress too html vishwas believed keen fighting from rahul gandhi constituency amethi had earlier said have applied for lok sabha ticket from amethi and the committee will decide this html robert vadra issue there because involves famous person the fact everything like this happens everyday haryana certificate change land usage happens everyday one the well known analyst haryana chaudhary said that don have corruption haryana brazen loot course will make issue think aap extremely positive development for india they certainly have shifted the center gravity indian politics the cleaner side ,1
aap going eat away the congress and the regional parties vote much more than the bjp vote per the last known internal calculations aap expected get around seats while the bjp would still around 200 the biggest perceived advantage aap that they would contain the gandhis and the top congress leadership the seats being fought gandhis any loss there even significant decrease victory margin would huge egg the face situation ,1
aap has divided youth voters they are not dividing caste religion most the immature fanatics are young people who haven seen 1990 ,1
hahahaha aap supporter but boy love the fact they have made bjp and moditards run shit scared like headless chickens think the country owe big thanks arvind kejriwal just for making moditards realise they have not won the elections already ,1
lets steps want congress free india corruption free india ans corruption free does bjp has image being corruption free and would make india corruption free ans there party that gives that hope ans yes there are aap loksatta which are mostly going come together how can bjp fight ans definitely not lame arguments the team but beating aap their own game become more accountable the people rti transparent disclose funding sources remove criminals field better candidates and not the likes bokhariya radadiya yeddurappa until bjp ready compromise with its election strategy based our demands see reason whatsoever compromise with demands and vote for bjp this the only way fight aap not incessant wailing splitting hair and definitely not ridiculous fear mongering ,1
 there chance for the aap win any kind majority the 2014 lok sabha elections nor will any other political configuration have entered the world post election coalition parties you are making the assumption that congress gone that the third front will bad would not count either those technically would stupid for aap not try test waters let see how the results come out also please understand that not everything about bjp modi please try remember that when you examine what aap does ,-1
aare you referring that aap should not contest just because would cause political unstablitiy shud india declared state for the dynasty politics bjp and congress would against religion kill dont make take arms not stopping you make stupid comments reddit and raising confusing topic have vote and would happily give aap matter what politics equation means end doesnt justify means,-1

arvind kejriwal thousand times better than congress opposition will make sure that bjp does not become another congress aap only helping achieve the target congress mukt bharat should welcome aap entry the scene although not supportive unfair amount media attention being given them ,1
false dichotomy either you are for for bjp you are out destroy the nation whoever has heard opposition that does their job properly and keeps the ruling party line ,-1
eli5 why does everyone else has nothing speak against namo except the riots mean has only one catch not juding him innocent guilty ,-1
man even though support aap would like bjp come power with absolute majority just because lot people strongly feel that they are the need the hour and bjp not make people lives better both economically and socially hope their supporters would criticize them enough make them change seek alternatives other than congress and bjp they perform well and good for everyone ,1
great post hope bjp supporters will explain their points and arguments against the aap succinctly systematically and without vitriol and aap supporters will forego their usual self righteousness and listen ,1
first all kudos you for summarizing some very thoughtful points against aap such articles are rare come this subreddit where most the political discussions end descending karma grabbing mud slinging matches and deserves more upvotes have your questions except for their infinite faith and ability simply presume good what the aap supporters base their support believe that the most the supporters have put their faith the past record activism one man arvind kejriwal which pretty much synonymous the case bjp main man narendra modi both their records are out the open for everyone see and fair kejriwal has been tireless social worker even before the whole anna thing blew guess both bjp and aap supporters need asking this question what happens when the sole leader doesn live the promises you vote for person ideology system how ensure that everyone sticks that ideology system modi fan myself but find very difficult answer that well the long run what can aap give that the congress didn and couldn only time will tell that one but most people are hoping for corruption free government lets see how far they take delhi the power collective good intentions the water and power policies not seem panning out how earth aap different from congress under the sun today same old minority appeasement same old subsidy tricks same old attacks narendra modi seems like aap the mirror image congress only under different guise you got there other than few fresh faces the same old system compromises over accountability hoping proven wrong they are freaking corrupt why the heck are aapians not putting them jail instead taking their help this what want understand give this one aap for they didn back down play the dirty game the situation demanded but there was good chance that bjp might have swept more seats there was election also their conditions stunt was just childish nonsense ,1
 short ideologically aap congress corruption bjp supporters needlessly worry about losing votes congress who should scared because their voters will gravitate towards aap what aap offering socialism which does appeal large section indians bjp more free market and has the baggage rss ,1
 find the question loaded bjp the standards which you need evaluate parties hint bjp not that awesome variety options better for functioning democracy left centrist party with baggage always welcome your points only bit worrying rest are just array silly exaggeration wrong assumption misrepresentations facts sure aap has its foibles but they are fresh kids with much less bad things than other parties come give them time prove their worth bit early write them off ,1
aap moving towards communist idea decentralization and putting things and people where they belong cpi and aap have both agreed this bjp and congress say something and something else point discussing ,0
 long they dont all right wing nuts and don have support from the likes kamdev and assaaram which the bjp has with aap ,1
 this the reason d84nwor r3a have started discussion elaborating apprehensions about aap hate aap because aap acting proxy for congress their jihad against narendra modi ,-1
 bjp has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like subramanian swamy clearly scholar learned person gentleman whose opinions should mull over analyze and imbibe with immediate effect ,1
long story short most indian voters are not really knowledgeable enough think too deeply about such things they support the aap mainly because the promise new messianic figure kinda like modi without any the baggage existing political parties ,1
bjp offering modi aap can offer anything worse than that tried ,-1
all those questioning aap taking support congress different people have different views his you asking why did take support congress others say should take congress support form government and show what can deliver the country now please you tell who should listen who would you have listened had you been his shoes the choice not simple but has listened his heart that what any sensible person his position would have done yes might succeed his commitments might fail but then the people are watching him closely should not atleast give him chance prove himself only been few days now and has stirred the political class with his stern decisions did bses ever dreamed that they will audited just within days becoming delhi can you already see the fears political class and corrupt the decisions and steps aap taking noone one amongst just like the friend you have who you roam around with everyday not vip just common man but his actions are not common all ,-1
 skulduggery aap made lofty impragmatic and somewhat unattainable promises but didn‚Äô get into cumbersome details they kept deliberately vague how these promises would kept please read the manifestos the promises are nowhere tall the ones made modi for example the aap spuriously promised give 700 litres free water the poor and according media reports they delivered all good then right but they did not deliver they only gave metered houses not the poorest people the slums who actually are the need that water this actually gives incentive the people delhi get metered installed besides although subsidized should not free there will lack motivation save seems unrestricted even only certain level average consumption middle class family more less 700l the limit acts encouraging factor conserve since can relieve them the bill opposition nuclear energy honestly totally disagree with this move however still need wait for official statement the issue because the reason why aap protested against the kundankulam was due their perception lack safety measures their flawed economic model the biggest problem they are yet release clear well defined description their economic policies and models but this should give sense what their stand ,1
man you should write article for paper honestly ,1
 aap grows large enough will split into various factions like the janata party did each these factions will handle the different criticisms one will hindu aam aadmi party another will pro nuclear aam aadmi party yet another will free market aam aadmi party ,1
the bjp you claim more free market but don think opposition fdi retail they might have their reasons those reasons might justified but still not free market economics questioned modi tendency towards free market economics when his government banned gutkha not spitting and public littering but gutkha while leaving the ban alcohol intact not elegant enforcement penalties domestic violence public misbehavior but easy brute force ban alcohol the ban gutkha caused drop areca nut prices don know about gujarat specifically but speaking couple farmers karnataka where the congress govt banned gutkha understood there was drop about prices much for free market economics this concern regarding anti laissez faire was accentuated bjp leaning towards preserving culture the recent official declaration their homophobia was just example one would want question the sanity the thought processes the upper rungs the bjp the congress too hasn shied away from culture preserving stances example the statements made the mangalore mayor condemning resort culture following the attack group reveling teenagers resort you asked what the aap will differently from the congress the aap was among the first political parties come out against section 377 the ipc that criminalizes anal and oral sex the bjp was among the first support forthrightly and directly criticize homosexuality western disease the congress came out against section 377 but seems more like move salvage some support when elections are around the corner despite having been power since the 2009 statement issued the delhi high court the congress motives here are questionable they also going after the power generation companies delhi irregularities are found expect lot high ranking politicians will incriminated this one more item that the aap will differently from the congress the aap seems delivering election promises however vague words have been followed actions unlike the congress you might consider not delivering water unmetered customers bad thing but this certainly encourages all customers install metered connections further consider such policies socialist something against given voluntarist leanings but this still better than crony capitalism where land offered throw away prices corporates such practices are the beginning the rise monopolies monopolies are irreversible without socialist revolutionary intervention between the aap and the bjp still undecided whom would vote for but the bjp doesn have that great case against the aap you make out while the aap might have displayed socialist tendencies the modi government hasn exactly displayed laissez faire the bjp whole not sure about given their spectacular failure karnataka you might worship subramanian swamy but think nut job you might say nationalism but say self righteousness and the bjp and their conservative culture touting support base has lot would much rather spend government money subsidies than statue not that proponent the former ,1

this not community some 200ish people who happen from india isnt this india where the topics discussion should about india and not about some frequent india visitors for any personal rebuttals name calling etc etc cant use instead its shame see the top post india bitch fight like this please correct wrong ,1
those that ran that sub were carrying out suspicious activity basically downvoting every comment that was against the bjp then downvoting any thread that had anything against the bjp was pretty sure that activity since when the downvotes would come they arrive huge numbers since was private sub many couldn see the activity that was happening there fuckers got jolt ,1

 dont get one thing the subreddit concept can greatly used for containment like circlejerk namoarmy wants furiously masturbate and upvote namoarmy what the problem still didnt understand how the ban and your description related because they were influencing upvotes other subs ,1
isn there mod setting whereby new users account age day old week old even month and users with low comment karma lets say 1000 both metrics for india are prohibited and limited comments per hour time frame the sub this won affect users with account age older than year and comment karma low hundreds seen few these users and they are mostly nice and only engage posts which are off beat these guys are lurkers anyway doesn affect them most them won reading the recent useless drama here anyway this account age restriction can extended even year strat ever perfect but one major benefit this would the incentive just act like tool without fear getting banned would less because the cost just creating new account and engaging more right away will increase dramatically there incentive build repo and since time and effort will have been spent user build that account she will act better more cases than currently the case said strategy perfect but its about managing the chaos one should learn useful aspects from the best the chinese censorship apparatus they don ban most things outright that never works instead their most common approach make the user experience hell and shitty possible why would someone use facebook some other site service every minutes the connection timing out slow and what not the incentive use longer there those who will persist their numbers will fall rapidly and very low and the goal achieved mods should work this direction they can not ban everyone and shut shop they need make the situation for idiots not worth their while spent all this time spreading here ,1

even though not practicing christian christian born and indian citizen this frightens thought modi was different bjp leader pushing national unity and all sad ,-1
actually bangladeshi hindus should accommodated india for the very reason muslims are part this country much hindus when india was partitioned two nations were formed india and pakistan while india chose remain secular nation giving equal rights all least theory pakistan chose become islamic nation where hindus not have the same right muslims india has accommodate all muslims who wish part this country because founders our nations decided this people may grudge this decision but have accept and fulfill this promise pakistan the other hand doesn have accommodate them and doesn try much fact that hindus bangladesh are suffering because religious persecution also fact that muslims bangladesh are not suffering due religious persecution first rule anyone illegally coming from bangladesh india must deported but humanitarian causes take precedence and based that hindus should accommodated india know that many hindus their hate for modi are willing forsake hindus bangladesh little more understanding the situation required bangladesh was same india then hindus and muslims bangladesh would equal people are overlooking the fact that hindus and muslims are not equal bangladesh hindus and muslims are equal only india and hence this contradiction use pakistan and bangladesh interchangeably for obvious reason not talking politics here anyone disagrees please debate not get your political agenda here ,1
 bigotry thought you were gone with roch but how missed you how would india india without your daily dose muslim bashing bigotry ,0
 source will have accommodate hindus from bangladesh modi 1403963 html modi have responsibility toward hindus who are harassed and suffer other countries where will they india the only place for them ,-1
apart from tweets couldn find any source him having said this leaving that aside don think any bangladeshi should allowed till sort out our own problems also though things should equal there are few grey areas though there might illegal immigrants from both religions which should strictly discouraged hindu immigrants might also victims ethnic cleansing which case they would and should have higher priority ,1
how anyone going verify the border who muslim and who hindu refugees could from either religion welcoming one set should welcome the other for those wanking over modi saying india the only place for hindus hindus can nepal bhutan any other country asia too india not hindu country secular country ,1
well what surprising what else one expects from bigot like narendra modi ,1

dat self righteous smug face lol first bangladeshi hindus are merely refugees but majority bangladeshi muslims are illegal immigrants and second what the most pita about bangladeshi muslims their sectarian and staunch anti national behaviour which causing huge disturbance most region ,1
 think that hindus both bangladesh and pakistan should given shelter india political asylum considering the international norms providing refugee politically abused and threatened people note that modi had said indian muslims are not indians that would not have been acceptable however giving refugee and integrating religious minorities from neighboring countries seems the right thing religious majorities those countries however need use legal modes immigration they wish rather than just cross over the border squat more resources ,1

 lokpal will clear corruption out india and even greater out indians highly unlikely corruption not crime but disease and remedy development education discipline change attitude laws and rules were enough change country years there would dowry khaps murders untouchability school donations india there would cocaine almost riots gujarat for straight years not because strict law against riots but because shift focus from religions roads and buildings administration and development lokpal aap what ram mandir bjp what poverty congress what reservation mayawati and mulayam,1
aap does not have the numbers get majority best you can hope for that the third fourth front get then they beg for aap support get who would then extract lokpal bill the cost for support ,1
 feel its herd mentality you see media and your friends criticizing and decide aap must bad uncool support anything they well how many have seen speech and read good news about him not many they don even read about and start calling him dramebaz surprised that people who oppose aap are against everything they well think has become ego issue many the people ,1
 the first place aap having real idea solution for any issue besides corruption big hit them the second place they don even have real solution corruption lokpal farce exaggerated dream all does add yet another layer investigative bureaucracy over the acbs cbi intelligence agencies cag vigilance commission and judiciary with them involved investigations will take even more time now but whether corruption will punished different matter and till date have yet hear answer for the very simple point what the lokpal members are themselves corrupt corruption has seeped even into the independent judiciary then why what use independent lokpal that leaves with reason vote for the aap this year beyond being disgusted and wanting spite the other parties which describes the majority their fans ,-1
 much the chaddiwalas out here india and facebook shiver their panties aap does not have the number gain majority and form the government modi going but aap could possibly form the opposition party and that could keep nda its toes ensure does not indulge too much corruption ,1
 you mean say vote for aap pass bill assuming very strong bill and let the country debt the vague notions arvind kejriwal water subsidy kejriwal new all these its like you are making engineering graduate the ceo multi million dollar company its likely going fall and guess what any chance any kejriwal proposed plans not work again going resign the bill can not throw corruption out this country all highly unlikely that even going happen another hand modi will develop the country infrastructure wise may look into matters like improvement rural areas problems electricity and water shortage etc arvind kejriwal just like small kid planning for summer the kid will have huge plans won realize the hurdles ,1

 don know much modi but far jayalalitha concerned she takes very few inputs from any section most the decisions are taken her within inner circles which imo she could have broader consultation would very good she has stern mind take bold decisions ,1
how this pro amma says has higher revenue much much higher excise revenue but same fiscal deficit the extra money going amma pocket ,1
 not modi fan but think ridiculous compare development metrics two very diverse states very simplistic way look the problem ,-1
not fair comparison amma has hardly been power while modi his 3rd term amma previous track record not good she was voted the worst was worst governed state don remember back when she was power the 90s she seems have big aspirations read and has the potential deliver here hoping she turned over new leaf and doesn fuck things ,-1
this infographic only shows you how developed itself but doesn say anything about what amma herself did this honestly useless you are comparing modi and amma ,-1
seriously did you infographic maker even consider the fact that alcohol tax revenues are significant contributor the treasury top off sells almost all its alcohol from tasmac designated government liquor stores and has rule that only alcohol made can sold imfl this random edit really downvotes this why stopped posting india and even deleted account previously really irritating really says lot about the quality person who lurks here you can post decent rebuttal atleast have the sense refrain from discussion lazy press the button disrespectful the community one gives rat ass about reddiquette damn disappointing guys damn disappointing ,-1

 don mind jaya problem she isn the one leading national coalition the chances her ever heading union government are close nil even the third front experiment succeeds against all odds way will mayawati mulayam mamata nitish etc set aside their own egos serve under amma say something about her not really showing the kind vision modi has economy infrastructure industrialization etc but the above will suffice she simply not going make ,1
wasn twain who said lies damned lies and statistics there popular joke which goes wife made millionaire used billionaire information such this gives you idea progress and development what you want see trend set trends truly understand where you are headed this gives you idea whether amma has made life better for her state namo has made life better for his dig deeper there are citations the sources information meaning don know the data trustworthy there explanation the calculation the data either all all very well created and absolutely useless information you really think about but really well sold ,1

point the way very important less fertility rate and less infant mortality rate both are very important and good example social development ,1
 glad that are finally comparing politicians development rather than other tertiary fish market arguments looking officials data shows that gujrat not doing any better than the other top states none the less gujrat among the top which good think the vibe created that gujrat magnitude times better than other states extrapolation definitely doing better than most states but other states cannot ignored which are doing equally well this infographics gives some incite that ,1
ideally modi should marry amma and they both can pms guess the state that their progeny will rule will the most prosperous the world ,1
 can believe people aren even considering the reason these guys were willing wag their mouths the guy who made this video apparently promised compile their heroic deeds and report higher ups some hindu samaj get them handsomely rewarded now too hard imagine why one would eager reveal one criminal actions before complete strangers can believe the naivete this thread ,1
what our other choice ,-1
the amount muslim haters this sub too damn high ,1
this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,1

 new search area pdf pdf looks like right top the diamantina trench ,1
the new search area very close diamantina deep considering how quickly the entire search force abandoned the previous location and that fact that the fbi was set have completed their analysis the captain hard drive they found diamantina deep his internet search history would both the kind credible evidence that causes complete shift search area but also something you absolutely could not release the public until confirmed with wreckage thoughts ,1
 does this debunk any ghost plane theories plane can make turns after new coords are input but never heard one automatically speeding ,1
 amsa and the atsb will hold press conference 1430 aedt provide more details the new search area does anyone know where this press conference might found online google skills are apparently lacking today ,1
amsa press conference live now ,1
here good graphic which have way verifying not sure already been posted not haven seen before shows overlay australia radar coverage and the last ping derived arc location the plane the arc goes straight through the satellite system which think already knew before someone highly motivated and with inordinate amounts free time could and stick there the various search areas and debris sightings that would super cool australia refuses confirm deny whether the plane was detected well according the trustworthy media but think either their system was down malfunctioned and they don want anyone know they did detect the airspace and are using that direct the search areas and are keeping secret for who knows why and need the doppler effect only cause cool either way can imagine that they did detect but are refusing use the info release other investigative agencies they spending boatloads money searching for this plane too and doesn make sense for them continue spending what they know incorrect also the plane was detected why would they keep that secret not like their satellite capabilities are secret don think this case the plane flying under the radar think this radar goes pretty low would have wasted enormous amount fuel and the pings probably would have cut off lot sooner think there good chance the plane passed through this region and wasn detected for whatever reason jpg,1
question possible the plane was programmed just before 000 fly that way until ran out gas and everybody board was dead ,1
 think easier hide plane for weeks than crash one and try find especially with countries and shitload satellites 24hr prowl with the whole world demanding answers ,1
 update still found debris black boxes evidence the pilot remain standstill ,-1
 aircraft arrived new search area and have not found anything that would classify debris australian official says html,1
live giving update search watch ,1

mas ceo will give press conference 6pm myt ,0
the elephant the room that more than likely none the debris that the satellites picked were wreckage from mh370 remember either hearing the news reading article about how ocean currents that part the world often bring together all the stuff ocean has collected over the years bystander and already felt hopeless and frustrated can only imagine how the families and search rescue team feel ,-1
 the new analysis that the plane flew faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance these factors would lead less flight time but time air the most concrete fact the ping data confirms these points faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance work with the fact the plane must also the air for hours ,1
 confused they are saying the plane was traveling faster than they thought more fuel was being used traveled shorter distance but they have pings all the way assuming the plane had not yet crashed until least that moment which would have stopped the pinging there concrete amount time had the air how could travel less distance when was traveling faster for the same amount time are they saying that they overestimated whatever time after the plane was the air which would have had less than hour and that compensates for the decreased distance ,-1
considering that the current search area takes hours get hours search and hours return for the hours flying time think everyone should thank their lucky stars that the new search area turned out 684 miles the northeast the current search area toward australia turned out 684 miles the opposite way the planes would have had nearly zero time the target search area before they had turn back fuel ,1
 look into the lives malaysia airlines flight 370 pilots lmyqjaxmta0mdiwodeyndgywj far they have turned nothing unusual the pilots ,1
given this new search area would that put the plane place where australian military should have picked ,1

expert organisations analyse available data and determine the best area search the key pieces information being analysed relate early positional information from the aircraft and
later polling satellite aircraft system the new information based continuing analysis radar data between the south china sea and the
strait malacca before radar contact was lost indicated the plane was travelling faster than previously estimated resulting increased fuel usage
and reducing the possible distance travelled south into the indian ocean the international investigative team supporting the search continues their analysis which could still
result further refinement the potential flight path this has been combined with information about the likely performance the aircraft‚Äîsuch speed
and fuel consumption for example‚Äî arrive the best assessment the area which the aircraft likely have entered the water the information provided the international investigative team the most credible lead currently
have the search aircraft wreckage however this information needs continually adjusted for the length time elapsed since the
aircraft went missing and the likely drift any wreckage floating the ocean surface finally let stress that under international convention malaysia has investigative responsibility for
malaysia airlines flight mh370 this stage the atsb‚Äô main task assist the search for the
aircraft this day the search for the aircraft‚Ä¶ have drifted the area for days movement taking into account the actual weather and known currents atsb spokesman unsure what the actual speed was the assumption that the aircraft was travelling somewhat constant speed data from satellite polling and radar matches satellite imagery may may not objects and may not debris fields previous search areas have now been abandoned could debris wind scattered around the world depending who picks ‚Äì under international convention remains the responsibility the country where the aircraft was registered any wreckage which picked will held for the malaysian investigative teams atsb operating behalf the malaysians any debris picked must handed over australian authorities new area will help get more aircraft scene for longer the other benefit the search area longer the roaring 40s ‚Äì which means better weather conditions more often debris has been seen the old search areas does not want classify satellite and visual spots those areas debris that just not justifiable with what have seen adds that this kind thing not unusual this the normal business search and rescue operations the new area based refined data possible that further analysis may change that again what are you actually refining the relationship between 777 performance satellite pings and various projections versus that information trying find the right coincidence those and the end point when the aircraft runs out fuel all engines die together there are range scenarios you still believe the course changed several times the best assessment the aircraft headed south consistently into the indian ocean are you looking other leads from the malaysian investigation the two primary methods are the analyses the movement the aircraft that the best information can have satellite imagery being followed but has produced sightings sophisticated oceanographic modelling determine drifts recall please that this days after the event was expected happen over that days there‚Äô significant amount random dispersion objects the search area gets significantly bigger over time data marker buoys are being distributed into new search area continue model drift and keep search area confined all data currently available has been made available the search ",1
here another hammer their quickness abandon the search area based this new data analysis plane speed means they have literally zero confidence any satellite images they have released over the last week does this means satellite imagery just not good enough useful this search all find this hard believe but with this current abandonment all can conclude that there ton floating garbage debris the indian ocean and satellites not able distinguish these pieces well enough this may truly impossible cause folks ,-1
the search area for flight has been updated after new credible lead was provided amsa more info here pdf,1
you know what seems fucked for and mind you this just train thought ordinary person these aircraft find debris drop navigation bouys subsequent aircraft and ships can swoop and pinch yet how many freaking bouys have they dropped and yet how many times have they gone for the search not saying fishy anything just wanted say how awfully difficult find any debris ,-1

 really happy see the comments here very well explained all the redditors sans few jerks here and there what huge huge difference between aaptards and modi supporters ,1
 right fine with that india got divided the basis religion and non hindus got nation their own why shouldn india cater the need the hindus plight from those countries because are secular fuck that why did the partition happen the basis religions then gandhi fucked over ,1
many countries make distinction between policies for asylum seekers and migrants common sense really ,1
dae think india initiated this kind policy will only increase the incidences persecution minorities pak and bangla imo should done only case case basis discretely and not publicly announced blanket policy ,1
blow modi ,0
 against this very clear how this works support the man doesnt mean that idolise him support his every move blindly means the field leaders that have available believe the best bet lead bring ratan tata the candidate for any party and they will have vote tldr support does not mean worship,1
india for indians only,0
hmm think the whole against illegal immigration and wants illegal immigrants sent back but wherever hindus are the minority and are being persecuted bjp wants them move india seeing india the only hindu majority nation this world tried arguing against this logic pointing out that there are already millions hungry uncared for indians who should looked after first rather than foreign national just because she hindu being persecuted have responsibility neighbor urge bangladesh protect minorities but beyond that against this notion should deport all illegal immigrants irrespective their religion grant them asylum needed case case basis ,-1
 take jab persons migrating legally should welcome all states should accommodate them infiltrators who enter the country illegally need tackled they tend disturb the regional functioning removed religious subtext less controversial interpretation ,1
very good ,1
this allowance refuge the base religion actually valid india was divided india east and west pakistan remember what basis religion bangladesh very much islamist state recognized hindus are seeking refuge due persecution they should allowed however muslims are crossing borders huge numbers than becomes whole new issue which would require diplomatic intervention ,1
old issue rehashed several time here modi wants india give asylum bangladeshi hindu refugees who came here escape persecution and growing islamic radicalism their home country increasingly common problem bangladesh but not bangladeshi illegal migrants general who just came here for economic opportunities because their numbers are simply massive and are causing major demographic changes several indian states ,-1
what wrong with that another lame ass attempt modi bow wow ,-1
 you know what are you comparing refugee status some people anti national scam awarding citizenship status some people think about and let know what you think ,0
 have answered this several times tldr whole heartedly agree persecuted hindus don have any other place earth except probably nepal somebody must help them ,1
 don need more poor people india are already nation with large scale unemployment and poverty why are allowing immigration people with little skills the reason why bjp wants pursue this create voting loyalists for the party congress has allowed unfettered immigration people belonging particular religion just increase its voter base ,-1
same they think this ,0
there are two categories illegal migrants first are those who want come india for economic reasons secondly those who are persecuted should provide asylum those who are persecuted and send back those who came here for economic reasons support modi stand this ,1
modi communalist the little fucker knows bangladeshi hindus are not facing any problems india but has play saviour role which had done gujrat for more than decade pakistani hindus are crossing border rajastan and they are welcomed and are given out ration cards bjp each individual welcomed with celebration ,1
what sickulars say about this live bangladesh for some years bangladesh secular isn ,1
why only bangladesh hindu and christains from pakistan are killed raped and murdered even secularist should accept them plus according these countries are hindustan why not support him ,-1
why does everyone assume those here further votebank agenda politics are only muslim all you are communal,0
here take india was partitioned belief that muslims living india will continue live unharmed similarly hindus living west east pakistans will continue live unharmed india will considered hindu nation where hindus migrating from west east pakistan will welcome take refuge muslims from india are free migrate pakistan now that hindus are not being treated well and they want migrate nation which was created for them they are welcome but muslims have their nation result partition they are not happy with situation there then they should try improve situation rather than move across border not question about hindu muslim question national resources national security and rights indian citizens hindus bangladesh are much minority that you will not notice they migrate india but muslims are migrating much population that has created severe identity crisis east india and pakistan with support china trying take full advantage that situation think beyond your hatered for modi and put india before anything else you will realize are critical situation with major threat from pakistan and china and have handle favor india without giving communal color ,1
this weird ,-1
 the real bhagoda ,1
 have only recently started follow indian politics but this seems absurd ,-1

the marriage being child marriage void initio add the fact that they have never lived together and the last time met her was the marriage which was years back see the desperation the anti modi brigade forcing them stoop lowest levels possible ,0
 don care about his personal life but brought this upon himself was not right him deny her existence previous elections and now finally admit before this one the one who publicly claimed has one corrupt for reading indian express article about his wife she came off someone who still admires and respects modi and wished nothing but success for him taking that into consideration its begs the question how modi views women general ,-1
international media will eat this especially when modi becomes the and goes international visits without first lady child marriage exotic india the western media would have field day ,1
 now the former rss pracharak had left the column blank the last four state assembly elections 2001 2002 2007 and 2012 why ,0
the marriage breakdown really irrelevant the issue arguably why modi was not candid about far arguably the answer our extremely judgemental and conservative society ,-1

 seriously wish somebody would tell what this ravish kumar trying say here that parties play caste politics that what fetches votes that moneyed interests support parties they support sin crime have money and support party your choice now right reserved only for the poor leaders cant wan raise stuff like poverty and retire expensive hotel why they need prove their aam nature sleeping the road mind you not critisicing supporting any one party here this all the reality india today and the people have gone large extent contribute tthis have you ever wondered why the south india has grown much faster clip because while caste important especially karnataka not hesitate vote outside caste norms are not satisfied with the governance the ruling party this why despite all the corruption here still leagues ahead laloo because knows cant sit his hands for years and ask for votes the name caste heck jaya brahmin and she wins landslide victories caste pox indian society even more north indian central indian states and that the absolute reality ,1
 have read extensively this election and sorry say that ravish kumar being partisan and giving one sided view here afraid will not surprised joins the aap soon like many other journalists ravish kumar talks caste politics and candidates being fielded the basis caste but acts like this exclusive bjp and congress which party does not field candidates caste and religion especially and bihar even aap has been doing the same thing many constituencies many their candidates many states are fielded according caste calculations vip candidates aap succumbs cong bjp ailments 1427157 html ravish kumar acts businessmen hotels have something with the elections are they campaigning for modi has seen them distributing pamphlets money even the businessman who publishing bal narendra comics has said only doing because wanted something that would sell not distributing free campaign material plus few tens thousands comics are completely insignificant voters national level the children who read them will not vote anyway and general ravish seems very disgusted their prescence why have private businessmen suddenly become evil ravish employer falls the same category and many the aap and bsp politicians seems rooting for are also big businessmen like sanyal balakrishnan etc ravish observes that aap and bsp politicians not use expensive hotels while others while simplicity admirable does not have any bearing politician skills administrator the left and tmc politicians west bengal and the communists kerala are known for their relative simplicity and modest lifestyles but they are otherwise very thuggish and have not delivered good governance for their states least for west bengal ravish should look relevant things like manifestos promises track records etc ,1

 sad that every reporter who claims non partisan infact doing the bidding political party this was effort appeal the hindi speaking masses and love the construction but not the content how easily has bjp been accused indulging caste politics but there has been really been mention congress demanding all secular muslim votes the author failed mention that calling muslims secular all hindus are being labeled communal how easily has been forgotten that senior leader from aap demanded that muslims communal and the statement was later ratified the party the bjp has been accused putting star hotels but expenditure hoards aap workers being ferried air have been conveniently overlooked one cannot trust any form media person all everyone has make their own mind ,1
 would only like say war everything fair every party plays caste politics mean every ticket given the basis complex calculation what can you about this exactly what prompted selfpost how remove caste system that can come out this shit ,1

 appreciate sentiments especially when call for moderating behavior that said this election was way about aap aap continues the same line will lost oblivion within yrs deservedly the way left the entire corruption plank all out against sm1 who prolly the best leader have was not just stupid but unforgivable also think presumptuous assume that there tommorow aap india has resurged from far worse times thinking that only select band people can lead salvation horrible idea the same way congress led believe tht they were the only ones who freed india ,-1
 don get all this aap small party some people here and look back their post history and check how many threads they have started criticizing aap aap small and inconsequential why the fuck are you people giving much attention you expect better subredit good luck with that the only thing that might change that the paid downvoters might disappear think they already have ,1
now that the results that they probably wont even open the account dawning aap supporters they are resorting the but got the moral victory route saw that twitter seeing here you might genuine but sorry the general experience dealing with the aap walas had made many man cynical some points aap not even strong regional party let alone national party let alone party replacing the congress mon party that many doubt will even open the account already your mind replacing congress maybe sometime the next decade but not now not even 2019 dont know what you mean aap revolutionized this election didnt see aap campaign anywhere except few pockets delhi amethi varanasi and few seats punjab compared the modi bjp blitzkrieg there comparison like not this election was about one and only man modi india against corruption was delhi movement not national movement attributing what was pan national phenomena cutting across rural urban divide high turnout delhi based movement sheer madness people are just getting more and more politically aware and the penetration internet rural areas and dedicated booth level management major parties the main reason for increased turnout aap ridiculed because its impatience nautanki hypocrisy inexperience above all the nauseating self righteousness when they are actually cut from the same cloth the rest same caste religion and criminal politics dont argue this enough links have been posted with aap politicians indulging all these except few brainwashed and few idealists one actually buys the crap that aap trying cleanse politics mean when someone says wants clean politics and then takes tacit support from goons like mukthar ansari bsp etc you know they are just shitting had not accepted all poltiicians are corrupt that all institutions are damaged beyond repair and need kranti things need changed from inside constant small manner and not the jaldi badlegas which will only result egypt like chaos perhaps aap actually wants this not sure for under years need party that fuels hope focus capital building infrastructure development improving job market improving economy general providing decisive and efficient governance bjp the party for that and hence the overwhelming support for amongst this demographic years later once modi retires need not worry since bjp has awesome bench strenght and talks are already start grooming manohar parrikkar take over from modi need genuine secular left wing party play perfect complement right wing bjp inc occupies that position now aap had chance develop into sensible left wing party but their actions betray deep inexperience arrogance nauseating self righteousness and incompetence they have all but squandered the goodwill they generated lot and nothing short miracle can save them unless they change their current ways hope they sink into political oblivion because the nation cant afford second congress winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents winning what matters not the opponents realpolitik suggests the weaker the opponents the better ,1
imho aap started good party but later went sham spree lost most genuine support ,1
 going churlish and ahead and puncture your baloon one pointby one point certain that turnout this election result whole india against corruption movement even people who gave their votes bjp congress must have awakened aap some way turn out 2013 assembly elections highest ever assembly election history turn out rajasthan 2013 assembly elections highest ever state history 2013 turn out karnataka 2013 2013 despite what you might think voter turn out and interest politics amongst the young the middle class and the hitherto not interested educated masses not aap doing sure the iac movement anna hazare movement did raise lot eyeballs did the protests for nirbhaya but aap did jacksquat outside delhi heck fail get why you folks don understand core issue aap will non existent outside the ncr and maybe punjab they are non entity the south and west even the cities and the hinterland where some our population resides they are absolutely unknown but lets face aap much better opposition than inc for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still think the exit polls are absolutely horrendously over bloated towards the nda and the nda crowning not certain and aap feel will get seats and not back empty handed fingers crossed ninja edit typos spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and about the sucession plans premature though they may the bjp for all the faults non bjp supporters find with truly democratic meritocratic party and the distant future get parikkar chouhan would say they are arguably the best this country lead aside from amma but meh her corruption and arrogance will come her way ,1
agree with you some parts hope aap becomes larger and mature party the coming years but they need acknowledge learn from their mistakes start respect and admire the good work done others aap should also project same image they give impression that only they are the saviours ,1
 local government deals operational level example municipal corporation union government deals strategic policy level aap perfect for local level but their policies are too socialistic and backward for developing country should they develop superior vision will support them primary concern economy and education believe the more educated our country the better leaders will have will support aap city level every single day but they need mature and gain depth for the national level ,1

 had massive respect and high hopes for kejriwal and aam admi party until quit government delhi and jumped into elections for the reasons still can comprehend top that with his crusade against the most corrupt communal modi communalism worst than corruption development only corruption gujarat and the greatest them all muslims plz communal ,1
itt fucking immature retard making his point and someways proving truly belongs aap ,-1
when would aaptards realize that aaps plan simply align with the congress officially few years ,-1
every once while one the aap people post thread like this and they will get lectured why aap the worst thing ever happen india see you later the evening when this thread will buried among other things ,-1
loser aaptards circlejerk,0
not political enthusiast but have share this aap gave ticket one the farmer loyalist area and the guy made live phone call aap leaders and their party offices asking for some monetary assistance their reply was don have any money while their leaders were enjoying huge foreign fundings after few days they stopped picking his calls ,1
you sound genuine but let give you simple answer aap not national party just fighting elections from all the seats from india doesn make you national party you actually need win them and for that you need have structure place may next decade think even bsp once fought elections from lot seats india still considered regional party well kind but you get the point ,1
 two cents for the upcoming elections results mega thread 16th saw thread which mentioned exit polls for vips such section the main thread will highly appreciated also have make rediquette enforced mean some posts should allowed here and there otherwise all the fun will lost ,1

 ananthamurthy was mistake phat gayi dont understand how someone can say will leave country someone gets elected that basically says you not believe the due process your country and dont care about how the rest your countrymen feel since are democracy there mistake here basically had said fuck you the rest the 850 million voters smarter than all you collectively now sir gtfo,-1
 slightly unnerving that dissenters are being spoken treated like this very much democratic and necessary have dissenters such ananthamurthy although some the things says are crazy everyone entitled their opinion long they don force others why should anyone else care ,-1
arre yaar contribute nahin kiya ,0
 modi victory triumph advertisements and media management said what shameless fellow modi spoke 477 rallies rahul spoke less than that and modi rallies were lot bigger average not acknowledge that hard work part nature elitists like him who sit their ass and feed themselves old glories ,-1
bjp let alone nda has clear majority with wide margin fully expect them fast track all the good work and make some drastic changes this five years that will establish their ground for next years anything short this would disappointing would not have such expectations they had barely formed coalition majority ,1
 few other anti muslim innuendos few clearly you haven been following india for the past few months don think there anything worry about though mean what the worst that can happen modi the bjp can anything that goes against the constitution the court judgements even comes ram mandir issue ,-1
hope they sideline issues like ban beef export cow slaughter ram mandir asylum for non indian hindus etc uniform civil code good thing though also let see what they will about the much talked about black money swiss banks direct income tax reforms measures prevent corruption police reforms judicial reforms foreign policy changes curbing illegal immigration failing act not option coz the end the term they won have any excuse they have majority their own don have worry about the coalition dharma bullshit also free from the influence jaya maya mamata ,1
this precisely why was afraid the bjp coming into power don care about 2002 but would very pissed the state becomes embroiled religion some has already happened with this thrust promoting indian values whatever the hell they might please give development and economic freedom don thrust religion culture down our throats you let the people decide who put power not let the people decide what they want read what they want watch and what values they want adopt ,1
need absolute focus development supporting farmers and industries cultural imperialism hindu values ban valentine day nonsense regulations women working late these are all issues which will the critical eye with which should watching our government ,1

 totally agree the bjp party have heard have promoted religious advancement whether purposely accident instead fixing india social reforms and poverty stricken lands believe the bjp nationalist view the right view towards aiding the country benefit the people and social development not the economy lets just hope that modi will focus less his religious aspects india and more the country health have also considered the samajwdi party for their socialist views equal india with healthcare welfare and working rights for all will surely benefit the country but looks like they are not having too much recognition but please want hear more from the people who are actually being affected this election just interested student from the states,1
lets not ak49 this new govt give years and comment ,1
dae find amusing that the same comment the top comment and the bottom comment this thread wtf going here facepalm ,1
let him make government lets see who his cabinet people were worried about all those elements before and after elections gujarat and before loksabha election bjp not even governing the the states india wants win 2019 wants get some seats and increased his voteshares kerala and will worried doesn any development work promised and wins 2019 then will back hindutva most voted for modi bjp not modi supporters 180 million indian voted for him pretty sure there are more than hard core criminals voted for modi rahul doesn mean modi rahul criminal too ,1
 religious things include ucc 370 and illegal immigration then they should certainly they can prioritize development over but they should deliver their manifesto what with people claiming they shouldn the things they stood for and got votes isn this why hate politicians that they discard their agendas and manifestos after voting certainly think they should everything that they promised long tune with the constitution they should also not things that are the polar opposite what they said they said sabka saath and sabka vikas and they should live its spirit being pluralistic also ,-1

 can really understand why keep getting these submissions from what appear first time voters rss the ideological mentor the bjp both abv and namo were former pracharaks rss has influenced and shaped the way they and most their would ministers think why should the bjp disown its ideology just please section the college going first job junta the voted for modi but not cool with the rss bjp better stay away from them else vote will aap next time crowd while one wants modi give any importance the lunatics the sangh parivar expecting him the bjp stay away from their ideological mentor stupid voting for the left and making submissions about karat staying away from socialism the bjp has put emphasis development and that where their focus should but issues like the ram mandir should way forgotten just because handful first time voters want edit don forget construction ram temple also part pre poll promise and lot people would want see that happen not because don have enough temples india but because will the logical conclusion the movement that for the first time asserted hindu nationalism the temple about restoring the lost pride not very different from construction somnath temple post independence the razing the mosque was sad event but when plea hundred years falls deaf ears frenzy takes over ,1

 maybe just jaded but sounded like any political speech you expect from someone who describes himself nationalist lots patriotism and talk about future hope for the country attended speech given him before and very good orator this fine speech but hardly something that makes you shed tears perhaps the effect profound because his predecessor was someone incredibly ineffectual and passive ,1

 india has huge hard for modi hope you all live see the day when the modi administration will block reddit even worse gonewild censor movies ban internet porn start online witch hunt for bloggers arrest twitter users for hate speech try journalists and academics trumped sedition charges you all will get the comeuppance for cheering him the best case scenario will only the form censorship and curtailment civil liberties and not trishul carrying murderous mobs the street ,-1

 probably late this but how much the negative propaganda you really believe the propaganda against aap naxalite organization congress team both obviously claims that somehow people lapped these obviously originated the bjp think tanks and were large part the social media anti campaign coming from behind the scenes did you really believe what you were sharing was just win hook crook ,1

just comment looking this ama clear that the campaign was one the most efficient technology based and well run the history india and for that matter the world believe huge cadre intelligent folks tune with the pulse the world contributed however should not forget that namo and the higher brass the organization were willing incorporate the advice well this especially important very skeptical that different candidate such sushma swaraj would had been able pull off something like this really hope that this approach now used governance management and all other aspects our new govt would really like congratulate you and others job well done and hope that this just the beginning ,1
did your work involve actively whitewashing narendra modi involvement the gujrat riots and the incident general referring sites like this http www gujaratriots com total crap ,-1

talk about friggin priorities and when does city renaming fall into the purview central government amc gujarat government hasn yet bothered why should central government care proud gujarati and very comfortable with the name ahmedabad ,1
whenever people change name place they destroy history don agree with bombay called mumbai madras called chennai our future generations won even know that were was such place called madras calcutta and especially oppose renaming because these cities were made foreigners themselves although don really mind allahabad called prayag because muslims didn made allahabad they simply renamed however mind hindus change name bhopal bhojpal some people want because bhopal city was founded afghan mercenary whoever founds the city have the right name and people rename then they are culprits destroying historical relic ,1
everything easy for the fucking govt they extort money for such purposes that new level disgusting had hit list this fellow would suppose ,-1
this thread intellectual orgy let settle the score going back our roots khallas,1
why according all places should retain their names they were the time independence ,0
why would you want change history and why that are far more comfortable with british era monuments and buildings than anything from the mughal period this just more anti islamic more importantly denial history view the mughals lived one they didn just turn this country into big factory like the english they are much part our history the marathas the rajputs anyone else they influenced our culture dramatically you really want undo their effects you have undo every single mughal influence our culture good luck doing that and btw you going this like see equal changes any english names and buildings well starting with lutyens delhi,1
 fully support this initiative can this nationwide scale one shot change the names say 000 cities and 000 roads one shot that would fun come swamy where your ambition alternatively rename them names from least 000 years back refer old texts myths ,1
this what happens you grow your own weed kids ,1
what mughals british ashoka did beside the point they are part our history and can whitewash that what can change what leave for our future generations create new cities called prayag karnawati create new canals called saraswati create new industrial cluster called vishwakarma its about time forgo our reverse colonial psychology and move forward ,1
 much like swami master troll sorry the master troll there are thousand and one super urgent problems facing our new prime minister and wish him the best tackling those renaming cities not one them once completely eradicate poverty our women are safe the streets any time day both the cities and villages electricity and clean water etc etc once all that done yea let discuss this renaming any politician brings the renaming issue its because they want keep the people distracted from some nasty shit being pulled off let smart and let not allow ourselves get raped again ,1
yes because that the most critical issue facing this nation fucking idiot ,-1
 just think unnecessary cost the exchequer and the government will likely fight tooth and nail and likely get some ammo for the assembly elections ,-1
please stop this renaming don give shit what place called even the word india not indian are gonna change that too ,-1
lol ministry swamy how long before turns modi and starts singing praises jayalalitha ,1
almost never agree with this idiot but its high time allahabad should renamed back prayag ,-1
 also said easy for govt but doesn have done also why are many people opposed even suggestion its line with indian heritage ,1
this guy makes sense sometimes but also says the most retarded things whole bunch times people like names which they are familiar though changing names under british india wasn bad enough after years actually suggesting the changing names which are many hundreds years old this kind tokenism much worse than the kind congress stood for ,1
these touchy religious nutbags again how about focus some real issues for change instead majority appeasement ,1

thats good has very strong command the hindi language hearing some our politicians speak english makes cringe because their poor grasp causes the impact their message lost let the translators their job ,1
 ammal was director kalaignar fulfill legal requirements the company and she does not know any language except tamil her counsel told the court addition shanmugasundaram said she can recognise anybody except close relatives and that she years old and needs medical attention health grounds won oppose the bail application moved dayalu ammal said the public prosecutor lalit however opposed the bail pleas all the other nine people accused the money laundering case including raja and kanimozhi dmk rajya sabha and minority shareholder kalaignar ,1
not opposing bail not the same dropping investigations everyone but the most dangerous criminals are entitled bail dayalu ammal not active politician business woman she just someone propped director meet govt requirements this very common thing all companies since until last year you needed directors shareholders for private limited company you wanted start business and doing all the hard work for why would you want give away shares stranger you just get your wife mother daughter etc some other family member you trust will not act against you the other shareholder directory makes more sense for woman because they get better tax breaks and also the misogynistic reason that they are under someone control wah modi modi runs the executive branch the government the judiciary courts are not and will never under his control the courts grant bail not even the govt prosecutor agrees the bail the judge can refuse and the judge can deny bail even the govt prosecutor demands otherwise ,-1
 think this because many the accusations made earlier had evidence back results wild imagination fueled prospect gaining political capital maligning the opponent secondly there another issue that often these allegedly corrupt guys hid their tracks well ,1
maybe because aap lok sabha candidate from hisar yudhvir singh khayalia gave him clean chit ,1

because they that vadra the congress will the same them when they come into power and you have retarded believe the congress won come back power eventually there implicit agreement between political parties that because every politician has some skeletons his closet the degree varies but every politician corrupt the very nature the game attracts certain kind player they bite vadra right now the congress will come back bite them ,-1

they have already said the law will take its own course and there will personal vendetta against any1 and the investigation already underway rajasthan ,1
there personal vendetta and the law taking its course the more they talk about know media will say vendetta over development and the true faces and colours are showing and all that nonsense what not personal vendetta was quite rightly election issue have idea why you confuse these two people india had reminded about damaad shri especially the time elections and that what bjp did looks like you want namo not allow the law take its own course and make this priority then modi above the law headline waiting which will followed the evil dictator reference seen enough will the right thing your efforts equate nda with upa downright silly ,1
 would say that congress has used the cbi create incriminating files all opposition members probably same with bjp the same way how and bsp hate each other yet have done nothing against each other when they come power ,-1

bjp won touch vadra vadra didn about his land acquisition spree himself you need others play their part too the reason why bjp won investigate and out corruption congress they congress will out the corrupt amongst the bjp yes bjp and congress are the same sides the dirty coin and they will hold each other ransom using bjp fanboys will never admit that ,-1

what caught eye was his pointing out the application the term sacred history semitic faiths and myth non semitic faiths including course hinduism amused because ‚Äòsacred history‚Äô deliciously creative euphemism for ‚Äòchristian mythology‚Äô concrete and real sounding the word ‚Äòmythology‚Äô have noticed over time reserved anglophones for any non semitic stories greek norse hindu buddhist roman etc whereas when comes time describing their own mythology anglophones use ‚Äòscripture‚Äô and never ‚Äòmythology‚Äô but think ‚Äòsacred history‚Äô even better implying there ‚Äòreal‚Äô history and then ‚Äòsacred‚Äô history which true there history and then there myth and ends thus with exceptions like amitabh ghosh‚Äô ‚Äòthe shadow lines‚Äô the entire corpus indo anglian literature leaves little cold like making love through interpreter ,1

 favor look the banner this subreddit now look your words your words match with the spirit this subreddit can you not understand that muslims are large group people and they not all act and think the same but when you lump them together they then you are the one causing problems you think you not have any prejudice against muslims all that these are truly words you believe you will able live with muslims alongside you brothers don think you are going judge every muslim you see based these things you written above which many them have nothing with then how can you expect peace and civility among and with them why surprising that muslims are sometimes violent agitators and sometimes victims violence just hindus are islam and hinduism deal with violence and they deal with peace because they are religions for people and people are violent and people are peaceful your post isn enlightening anyone all you are doing spreading hate towards people you not know there are peaceful muslims and violent ones and there are peaceful bjp members and violent ones parties and religions and groups are all made people and you not account for that diversity then you will never able deal with other kinds people there are mullahs who speak against violence the bohra syedna one can think and there are mullahs who provoke just like there are politicians who speak against violence and those who promote cannot have outrage all the time there isn enough time each day outrage over every bad person the world but for every bad action there are some who are outraged regardless religion any other silly grouping factor again look your words look the banner this subreddit does this post belong here ,-1
wow such deluded hate the anti muslim brigade could maybe spread little love around than cherry picking and spreading lies and hate maybe you should talk about how islam encourages charity and compassion wait they don pay for that they and remember when you generalize 8bn sect the basis small group amongst them you are better than the called muslims who spread violence and hatred you just following their footsteps and claim have higher moral ground ,-1

 completely agree this what been trying say here most redditors here see anti muslim comments and immediately start screaming hate without thinking that the feelings may justified due india historical and ongoing relationship with muslims yes india tolerant state and has always been one but muslims general don see tolerance something aspire emulate they see weakness exploited the path turning yet another country into islamic one see evidence this even outside india just look the actions muslims take western countries which they achieve even somewhat significant proportion the population ,1
disclaimer muslim hope you considered that you cannot blame the whole community for the action few know not few but these blood thirsty people cannot considered muslims those who kill innocents are strictly not muslims they may call themselves but are just blindly using religion excuse islam doesn approve encourage wars against non believers most these just uneducated people who have nothing please hope you change your wordings and place groupings carefully for you continue scout topper would soon degraded damn terrorist ,1

this monumentally political move you promote your collective mindset the rest irrespective what your motivations are this will obviously implemented with bias because lets face the mods are mostly certain political slant you are trying essentially take speech you feel offensive like secular communal offense subjective thing and also question taste and the audience the audience disagrees with the post they will exercise their opinion not need the mods sanctimonious also where was this outrage when people said should wipe out and bihar because rapes anti statements due freebies all those qualify hate speech too but did not have the equivalent indira gandhi approving editorials now did why that your sensibilities are more hurt people offending certain religion point not that one less hateful than the other but that your perception also skewed your politics this your subreddit and you can spread whatever propaganda you want but don act holier than thou about you taking offense things that the large number don evidenced the votes you truly want open and balanced make more people mods people who are not perceived being biased the current set before implementing these regressive steps ,1

just for the context this thread context most the offensive comments stand deleted just posting context the top comment was something the lines mass killing and ethnic cleansing mean there was even one user who corrected saying wasn ethnic but religious cleansing wtf does matter then plethora muslims must pakistan and such mean all for trolling troll all you want but the moment you step from harmless trolling into lel kill teh maslims then not trolling class douchebaggery reddit free speech site yes but free speech doesn mean you espouse hate and killing regularly bicker with rahulthewall and both and know harmless has never fucking lost his temper but then one you gents start calling him aapiya and what not and the discourse moves from lels don want listen you because you once wrote something favor aap really guys that fucking mature please ahead and troll all you want but don bring mass murder into discussion and please don call left right center because that fucking ruins any discussion with without lels ,1
whats wrong with letting downvotes decide what goes and what does not you first say the propaganda not combined sentiment india but then say that these hateful comments got upvoted the top which that what this group made then that what the group made all the rules shutting people will not help and what someone calls for killing all terminally ill vegetable people that hateful genocide talk the non painful killing certain parts society for some argument for good society then what can not discuss these ideas ideas like these ones why put religion some holy pedestal that cannot touched dirty hands why mods want get into the business controlling content here because you can get into legal trouble for whats posted here think the only time you should intervene when people make personal attacks one another personally but one here can assume the responsibility defending group matter how that group defined cents edit typos,-1

 sorry putting here but the unverified twitter rule isn working seen several links unverified twitter accounts getting india front page agree that difficult moderate but having rule and not following following sporadically worse than not having the rule the first place please have look into the matter ,-1
this great initiative and can think any better solution the problem hand however fear that may too much work for you the effort required manually monitoring all comments would much greater than your present workload far the sub has been moderated very well the motivation your team for essentially thankless job certainly not lacking but pretty soon will having thousand concurrent active users well guess you would have already discussed the consequences the move just hope that the everyone was board with the added responsibility you later feel that this not possible the sub can potentially brainstorm over other possible solutions though presently have none offer will certainly awesome you pull off best luck ,1

ideally affordable health care should human right india has been spending much less than other brics nations healthcare and education and this definitely needs change fdi assisted insurance programs combined with government subsidized healthcare might way this however given how things progress india not sure this will ever become reality the opposition plans putting the insurance bill into cold storage through the rajya sabha majority not sure how the kind subsidies required implement this kind program will affordable for populous and mostly very poor country like india ,1

when modi asked for people participation keep the nation clean meant exactly this perhaps should have spelt out these dumbass kids whose parents never taught them clean their litter after them few years ago had opportunity talk reporter from the hindu who told story sometimes the president india likes address the reporters press room casual manner the rashtrapathi bhavan and always there are refreshments and such provided the journalists when abdul kalam was the president had one such event went for about minutes and they were about wind kalam had noticed that there were couple coffee cups plates strewn around lying the floor near the journalists chairs promptly asked all the journos clean behind them and added you see was teacher first and will always one think this class exercise and realize that there nothing demeaning about cleaning after oneself should also add that sometimes people not know exactly how they can contribute when you ask for people participation keep our country clean some may not know how contribute and many may not even realize the effects their actions how plastic bags are strewn around this picture give them solid task and you can expect them think duty modi could have just asked our indian citizens present there today clean after themselves what little extent they can and then perhaps these kids might have got teach kids values give people specifics about how contribute also anecdote involving abdul kalam when was the president ,1
how nobody pointing out that modi well known fascist who endorsed and encouraged genocidal mobs against muslims the gujarat riots listen someone who has gone through sexual violence course want world leaders speak the issue but not world leaders that facilitate genocide sorry but the selective praise here really disturbing ,-1

americas rape statistics aren much better ,1

another less emphasized part this article modi also used his speech speak out against the practice indian family‚Äô selectively aborting females the woman abandoning female babies once they‚Äô born earlier this week the indian government announced that the sex ration among children ‚Äî standing 927 girl children per 000 boys ‚Äî the lowest ‚Äô been since india‚Äô independence 1947 ,-1
 not everyone was pleased with modi‚Äô speech however members the indian national congress were less than impressed with the scope modi offered overall his speech ‚Äúgiven that was the first address the new prime minister one would have expected certain vision articulated him the trajectory the next five years ‚Äù party spokesperson and former minister manish tewari said ‚Äúbut unfortunate that got bogged down pedestrian issues without being able rise the occasion ‚Äù pedestrian issues what does tewari consider not pedestrian issue this pedestrian ,1
yeah one was talking about rape until heard this brave speech ,1

 dont think one cannot expect him understand neither scientist nor doc have engineers who believe homeopathy why single narendra out for very common our country ,-1
how disappointing homeopathy load bullshit not surprised though growing always heard parents and relatives talk about and just thought was medicine wasn later until looked and realized how much bullshit ,-1
 one step forward and two steps back you cant cure cancer with just placebo you know this just sad ,-1
 well that let down against modi for this ,-1
 think this just symptom much larger problem with indian society most not all will probably have least one friend family member who believes homeopathy india lot educated people including people scientific background believe not surprising that our believes legitimate what necessary that such contested beliefs should not affect policy for instance homeopathy should not promoted officially the government for anything more than minor incurable ailments where application homeopathy placebo theory will not cause any harm ,-1
one the basic tenets this science called homeopathy about dilution leads direct contradiction with basic results chemistry not surprising therefore that the scientific community considers quackery the same time heard from many different sources that homeopathic medicine itself has helped cure diseases like chronic allergies asthma etc ,1
 not really fazed this news most our people believe our govt bestowed one the highest honors the nation homeopath why should surprised that our new believes ,1
you know who doesn support homeopathy kejriwal ,0

homeo not farce one relatives getting treated for schizophrenia the medicine being administered him without his knowledge long story effects the illness amazing control his schizophrenia and outbursts absolutely side effects doctor had said that year they can cure permanently not placebo patient does not even know ,1
 there should not question conflict between allopathy ayurveda and homeopathy all the three systems treatment have some best things them said chief minister said that homeopathic medicines prove very effective the case teething children seen that the irritating teething process makes children extremely weak and malnourished would great service the homeopathy can used for keeping strong the immune system child during teething process and thus preventing children from malnutrition regarding this appealed homeopathy association launch drive for curbing malnutrition some context would good its not like anti modern science unlike our kulcha who anti alternate medicine alternate medicine working for some who are force them stop using whatever happened freedom choice only applicable when suits our ideological propaganda ,1
 think homeopathy doesn hurt sure has some benefits but cannot replace medicine homeopathy probably does have long term benefits should encouraged because very economical for india and has side effects why not ,1
 the humanity ,0
you guys are really crazy someone who has tremendously benefitted from homeopathy with modi this one ,-1

 know the current science says bullshit but thing works for and everyone family when was had chronic joint pain that refused away for months after using homeopathic remedy the effect was immediate there was gradual reduction pain within hours and week gone completely have used homeopathic remedies for many other things after that and the results were more than satisfactory another thing want say the current science doesn have explanation for everything have explored nothing also big pharma the big mafia downvote this all you want but just wanted share experience ,1
better than pumping shit load anti biotics chemicals strong medicines for simple ailments babies,1
this the end humanity ,0
this thread farce the mods themselves rather their friends and alt accounts are the biggest political propgandists bigots and trolls india yet these accounts never face any action and instead when reported mods bend over backwards defend them against the complainants and attack the latter ,-1

 listing alleged incidents meerut faizabad and ghaziabad bajpai said ‚Äúhave they got the certificate rape girls because they belong particular religion ‚Äù what load horseshit guess most notorious rape cases this country were all from these religiously licensed communities right sure why can the population commit the rapes that sounds legit man the level which these bigots will for votes and politics has fucking limits making issues like sexual harassment and rape religious one the lowest form politics one can play but then again what can you expect from this fucking toad bjp can survive without anti muslim rhetoric they need hindu votes and hindus can unite internally unlike muslims they probably are too busy give shit which good getting them hate each other all they have got all this development and vibrant nonsense will crystal clear next 5yrs and they fully aware which point divide and conquer will and has worked best they know ,1
this saddening hear again and again they are slowly demonizing the whole muslim community gain votes and get into power why the fuck can they stick the development mantra and read this know about who were raped and who got sheltered ,-1
this hopeless bigotry will live and continue keep sections society apart since when rape religious problem have there been recorded rapes from hindu communities and panchayats divisive rhetoric like this will get you votes the short term but will absolutely fracture unity the long term why can they simply stick accomplishments and policies ,1
what kind sick fucks exist this country who are willing look the other way when the ruling entity the country blatantly labeling whole religion rapists based the crimes few really are you that blind did you not get educated look people people and not members ascribing faith what poor faculty tolerance and then they act all miffed when you lament that the country isn improving mind you all bad the hindu muslim murderers and rapists who believe okay kill people based who they worship just because your bigotry hasn reduced barbaric violence now doesn mean never will fact means there much higher chance you being the first people join violent movement against some other religion sick fucktards the entire lot you and don give that shit about having holier than thou attitude normal you the unevolved barbaric hordes living way out the time when the majority the population was like you ,-1
this good way they now are upfront about what they stand for sneaky agenda packaged with other bigger idea like search toolbar addons also wonder what modi thinks about this strategy wait remember this just footpath politics nevermind ,1
well they can rally and say bahut hui mehangai maar ,0

 been bjp supporter for these elections but this pretty damning evidence they should not allowed form state government the current assembly under any circumstance for what its worth still think aap idealist politics positive much smaller level such the municipal level but their uber socialist economics destructive legislative level rather see them take over the municipal corporation ,1
 bjp has decided not defend sher singh implying that the video very likely real and yet all the msm channels tuned chose ignore the press conference need more proof the governments influence over media ,1
apparently bjp delhi pulled down their site for short while after this vid came out delete all pics sher singh with bjp bigshots afaik this sher singh guy has shady property biz the side and well connected rss edit sher singh dagar wikipedia page has been deleted lol ,1
this just sad this video true sher singh didn deny its authenticity then shows how brazenly the bjp trying poach this mla the saddest part that don think anything will come out this bjp might still manage cobble together government taking support from congress don put past them waiting for the supreme court hearing tomorrow which will hopefully give decisive answer this whole drama the fact the matter and what people seem ignore that there corruption everywhere around this shouldn come surprise ,-1
 seems like bjp has decided not defend sher singh ,0

and there are some commenter twitter and elsewhere who are saying things like modi should intervene etc they really think the guy who spent 5000 crores black money win the elections thinks what happened here wrong probably will punish the guy for getting caught and the bjp wallahs will say our modi great doesn tolerate this when the opposite the truth recent tweet kejriwal bjp expels dagar will they also expel all those who appear future stings don think they have any more videos but guess any other bjp mlas members who made similar offers must shitting their pants right now ,1

primary reason for this that india divided between sickulars pseudo seculars khangressi sanghis chaddis bhakts rightwingers most people each side address the other want honest debate the name calling has stop and you are much guilty this the next guy seen you asking where the secu liberals are many threads recently that support your political viewpoint just shifts the focus from the content ideological shitfest even may guilty extent heck even feel that the sole purpose most users submitting these links put down the other side rather than have meaningful discussion edit grammar,1

swamy the man,0
can someone explain how swamy vindicated arnab said swamy can call srilankan and ask for the fishermen release india swamy does just that isn now arnab vindicated since swamy was able just that ,1
 supposed appreciate and praise this guy curse him like two face says and does some amazing things and promptly does volte face and says shit diggy raja would proud while the vaiko and jaya circlejerked seems out there getting things done good stuff indeed ,1
 think some the stupid shit that swamy says deliberate that his awesomeness keeps getting dismissed everyone with every raja kanimozhi jaya that goes jail with every sonia rahul daamadji that has uncomfortable fire lit under their asses for fraud with every fisherman saved with every black rupee that comes back india smarter people first and then more impressionable people will realize who serving the interests india you people really should try and give him shot not because needs has shown many times how much patience has fight individual battles but that you pay proportionate importance words actions ,-1
 think the battle rages gadkari hand may behind this intentional instability one can dismiss that possibility the battle yet end and few months after that that the dust will settle and give clarity until then bad for bjp since going polls few other states where potential allies will put off this dirty public linen ,-1
 wouldn even mind bjp ncp government rule the state for years and divide the state later bjp will win vidarbha hands down without almost opposition and they work properly rest maharashtra maybe they can make the other parties irrelevant well ,1

itt fanboys would find any silly excuse they can defend this act ,-1
sab mile hue hain technicalities aside modi and fadnavis have lost the moral right face the voter after taking support from ncp the only way bjp can redeem itself working with breakneck speed adarsh and irrigation scams,1
this risk transfer ,0
fuck modi shah and fadnavis technically they can say they didn take ncp support but means going back promise prosecuting the corruption ncp they will happy but don think there chance anymore ,1
congress government bjp government looks like sharad pawar always winner ,0
 extremely shady for them this and try pull wool over the eyes maharashtra voters but can help but impressed how they proved majority despite lesser numbers put congress place bjp and imagine yourself being impressed classic hypocrisy ,1
they cheated their voters what brilliant about was any other party the fan boys would raving here like mad dogs but since its bjp they are trying give positive spin ,1
politically masterstroke can only think caesar outwitting his opponents who came with blocks his career every other way wrong not the fucking ncp wish they had the balls fail the floor test and gone for reelections they would have held the moral high ground the least maybe even come back with thumping majority understand real politik and all but thikn all voted for party that was not the fucking congress shenanigan like this remind indira india cannot believe they might have cut deal with fucking sharad corruption pawar also how stable will the govt chacha will hold fadnavis his gonads threatening instability best even now relinquish for reelections ,-1
brilliant you must kidding this not statesmanship this brinkmanship bjp has just shot itself the foot big time not being accommodating long time partner one thing humiliating them cocking snook them and making them look like idiots entirely another thing and bjp just ended doing the latter god save them they don work out their skins some dazzling work the next years anything they painted themselves into corner now and use cricketing analogy they have now score century every innings they play the next years they don deliver even give the impression that they haven delivered they are toast years time this what happened bjp taka albeit under somewhat different circumstances and even pan indian modi wave could not save them yeddi with all his scandals could bring taka bjp its knees and lasting harm sure can worse few more months year brinkmanship from the bjp and mns will forced ally together then you have escapees and asylum seekers from ncp and cong crossing over instead using this opportunity finish off least the cong and ncp keeping close closer don corleone would say the bjp have let themselves get carried away delusions grandeur state politics are entirely different cup tea from national politics modi shah will deluded think they won the war they have best won round cross border fire skirmish fadnavis modi and there only much modi can actively coach from the sidelines while also doing his day job the country billion people seriously get the feeling that bjp going find out few things the hard way ,1
 congress mlas suspended from maharashtra assembly for years hahaha ,1
not even half brilliant evil sharad pawar basically played everyone the state like fiddle whilst his very lowest anyone won this fight was him this what had work with the biggest anti incumbency factor recent history party reputation tatters even lower than congress state leader the most hated man the state significantly reduced personal clout this what did pleased his core constituency marathas lot even before the centre elections and made sure too many them won over the bjp broke away from the congress and became extremely quiet till the election killing lot birds with one stone ncp could wrest some seats away from congress get great position chum with bjp hurt and mns breaking marathi votes and give themselves the best chance retain many seats they can they got which amazing given they were looking total rout after the election offered bjp unconditional support right the outset and became the towel their waist the condom their dick and this completely took bargaining chip away from them since bjp now had out bet correctly being rigid idiots and bjp being calculating assholes and the discussions failing utterly put the bjp power abstaining this the result they rode away from what should have been their execution with their core intact cong like the ottomans 1919 now its open season them his personal relations with their leaders means ncp prime position free grab whatever they can especially rss starts pushing their influence too much bet ranes atleast will interested looks like breaking there too proved can take care his friends now even his weakest played huge role destroying the saffron alliance don think non maha people will appreciate what incredible feat this was bjp have been through rougher times and never looked they will break ncp basically played iago better than laurence oliver ian mckellan and ken branaugh put together bjp are now minority govt and knows who they have thank for they even hint going big ncp people adarsh irrigation scams and pawar will pull the rug bjp will satisfied going after cong and some designated ncp scapegoats and everything will alright mns and raj utterly finished again another huge achievement but raj himself helped out lot regardless status quo preserved there 5th party the state now and the guy who was most openly against pawar and maratha appeasement projects like shivaji statue and reservations now silenced this bit pure speculation completely back formation vidarbha which fadnavis pet project this makes his people marathas even more dominant the remaining part maha rashtra and once bjp sheen wears off completely won have wait long either the sule pawars will back ruling the state fucking sun tsu could not have done better take bow cancer faced bastard maintain this guy one the biggest political geniuses the country apart from being great administrator and amazing diplomat weren for his out control personal ambition have been modi before modi still wonder what would have happened had become instead narsimha rao that ambition part would have been satisfied long ago would like frank underwood becoming sect state like wanted right the start season ,1

now directly competing with odac instead undercutting them you know schiit operating with business strategy that defies common business paradigms first most businesses first sell expensive product and use help build cheaper product that they market larger consumer base the logic that the halo effect the exclusive product will help drive sales the cheaper mass market for example light harmonic leveraged the aura their davinci dac for geek contrast schiit started with cheap schiit and worked its way the niche expensive stuff second while original designs tend complicated especially electronics they tend get simpler products iteratively evolve through generations again schiit the opposite although fair certain aspects the schiit business model does make lot sense offer base model and then rather than reinventing ghr wheel add features subsequent generations improve profit because you can charge premium for the added features for example auto companies this all the time staggering convertible models year two after they launch the sedan coupe and they are very savvy about marketing which again isn surprising given jason background ,1
 was planning picking the magni modi this week glad didn ,1
 just ordered nfb15 should see can cancel and get magni modi uber stack ,0
well just recieved old schiit stack which ordered monday what missing out ,-1
does uber have hardware mixer ,0
 assuming the original magni and modi drop price used markets they are still very worthy upgrade don really care about gain switch ,1
whats the difference between the regular magni and the uber edition ,0
 looking run sennheiser 600s these there any benefit sound with the uber magni modi versions over the regular magni modi ,1
god damn just bought magni modi few months ago really want get the magni just for that gain switch having constantly keep magni the lowest volume really annoying ,-1
stupid question but get just modi uber and magni can power set speakers like the audioengine ,-1
 schiit magni modi combo just arrived ,0
how would connect iphone source the dac the dac already plugged into the amp ,0
now the magni uber something can use ,0
asgard came yesterday bifrost comes tomorrow really excited also this hobby expensive balls ,-1
once again find stuff intriguing but also intrigued the decisions ,1
should get fulla these,0
this pretty noob ish question but now seems appropriate time ask there significant difference between the output the pre amp and line level output ask because have audio interface that has good dac and have intention replacing however only has line out ideally like able switch between headphone amp and integrated amp without bypassing the integrated pre amp without having switch cables would going from pre amp output the magni into normal line level input integrated amp issue other than having third volume knob adjust ,1
what the frick frank anybody want buy vali stack ,0
 support for 384 dsd into the trash goes ,0
 currently running first gen magni modi but might consider upgrade pair uber some amount time have powered speakers desk the preamp out magni uber would very helpful right now just moving cables back and forth and the multiple input the modi would allow solve the same issue with and ps3 usb from and optical from ps3 can imagine there perceptible difference audio quality but the extra ports would very useful guess just have decide convenience really worth should just wait until get some much nicer headphones and then upgrade higher end amp ,1
lel that favorite meme these days xdddddddddddd,1

yes your key point very sensible however you too are prejudiced and biased looking your own commentary counter questions about similar practices other religions you make valid point that false equivalency countering similar practices other religion way deflect the question recent examples include the charles hebdo incident where every single person india and very rightly condemned the attack however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right aren you doing the same thing which you accuse others doing you are using false equivalency and countering rss bjp narrative with charlie hebdo example you want the discussion limited critique hinduism without the use deflections giving examples other regions the same logic limit charlie hebdo massacre discussion what attack radicalized muslims not compare with bjp rss activities they are not the same category all ,1
some people believe that you criticize your own religion the absolute worst thing have often spoken here well real life when people wrong things the name religion and have been branded traitor agnostic atheist and paper jain egs speak against loudspeakers being used during ganesh chaturti get the you speak now when hindu festival but why not during eid arguments times basically cannot criticise own religion and want have criticise all religions otherwise anti hindu often times have been critical about jainism and its recent mutation into intolerant religion from peaceful tolerant one and have been branded traitor this irl the way many relatives and acquaintances they are quick point out that why not speak about other religions too often wondered about this and its always puzzled why have such mentality think the root cause lies the fact that not like being told what the problems are are too proud and not want others point out whats wrong home deep down know and make ourselves feel better sit and point out the problems with other religions and most the times the elders and the spiritual gurus and sadhus often use fear tactics quell such critics from their own home from speaking out they use social punishments like banishing one from the community and labeling people traitors this cents from own experiences such labels have not stopped and never will the argument that cannot criticise own religion bogus don need criticise others just criticise own ,1
this also reminds this twice gilded comment that probably the top comment any post here said however views india any india studies class the from bottom approach starting from problems indian society treatment women dalits religious minorities ascribes these problems hinduism and hindu theology caste system hindu patriarchy upper caste chauvinism which considered the fundamental block indian nationalism hindutva wars against pakistan and the indian state constitution government etc vast majority this sub completely agreed with this appraisal however nobody noticed the hypocrisy are viewing islam and islamic countries the same way ,1
 agree with noticed myself and whenever comment something religious have remind myself that mention something that wrong with hinduism have somehow bring the evils islam christianity otherwise get snark about secularism ,-1
well hinduism has been historically open change many rituals and customs 18th and 19th century have been outlawed are now obsolete still evolving abrahmic religions the other hand still justify pedophilia polygamy stoning kuffar killing and other monstrosities suggest keeping track posts and comments that bring commonplace regressive hindu light india sure you will surprised ,1
hypocrisy thy name india ,0
 there was call for reform hinduism then the caste system wouldn dying sati would still exist etc hinduism continuously reforming you are just too blind see ,-1
" think when comes general religiosity and adherence holy books hindus are fairly low down the order nobody here gonna defend dogmatists within the hindu religion the examples you cite are not really clear cut the ritual probably not encouraged today context but back then was simply not rape had child marriages the only form marriage the past but have moved from that and now consider social evil wrong right not absolute and has seen context also regarding the tamil novel you simply don know what you are talking about the problem more related casteism and libel than free speech now not suggesting free speech not factor this case but means the only factor lastly lot people criticize today islam because the literalist manner practiced lot people very regressive and outmoded belief system reformers within the community should ideally step forward but they are silenced via the religion itself non muslims affected will only naturally end criticizing then least they aren inhibited notice how similar criticisms are not made for any other religion also this means just indian phenomenonh

 malayalee guessing the nayars mentioned the article which doesn seem have any sources are whom know nairs don know any nairs who have such ritual their culture spoken two nair friends about both whom thought was making shit and here you are painting all hinduism with one broad brush probably dipped the same virgin blood the article talks but why does one talk about this hindu can take criticism etc etc probably because the article full shit lol this fucking thread people having shitfit over vague article that doesn seem clarify anything ,-1
 yet one seems reflect this practice but the post littered with crass humour this what most people here resort when they see something insult their favourite dharma their bharatmata their favourite politician you can read leela sampson being referred bitch here just because she dared pass and most people here hated the fact then foreign correspondent once wrote article slightly critical modi and yet again the right wing here bombarded her with abuses when rape gets reported from india the energy this sub channeled into how the fault worldnews for picking rape news stories from india you should understand the demographic the right wing the people who call others anti hindu and sickular their ego carries sense superiority accrued twice once when they are told how their religion the best and the second time about their caste being the most noble when they are exposed fact which strikes theose delusions their instinct label the other person jholachaap question his intentions anti hindu anti india perfect example who also the personal hero many here subramanium swamy ,1

 hope this doesn make pro hindu because don have lot with religion begin with having said that heres something for you ponder about you compared the killing humans bullying one person which definitely wrong well okay worries from north and dont know lot about speaking forced penetrations not sure how forced that its ritual for them which practiced specific community south would ignorant would like bina jane gyaan baantna but how are these forced penetrations different from forced circumcision why does forced circumcision spread across the world abrahamic religions not bother you are you sexist sir everything that fucks decent human life wrong doesn matter what religion that practice belongs the fact that you were able make the observation that you posted shows that you have bias well and suggestion for you would work that ,-1
tbh don think its problem with hinduism and hindus indian issue are incapable debating rationally and see criticism personal attack you say something bout hindus met with something worse about islam and why that not being criticized you say something about india people will say something bad about iran some other place and say india better than that say something bad about tendulkar and the response you get but but what about dravid who blah blah made that but see very deep seated resentment india when comes criticising their own yes and applies everything not just religion and applies indians general not just india,-1
 think the ills hinduism well documented the intelligentsia there isn one person here who not willing accept that some the practices are regressive the problem that the criticism the religion has become pervasive that the ones doing have become blind the ills other communities there way radicalization the minority community compared forced penetration but our intelligentsia for long time has thought and still thinks that casteism the mother all evils and need inherently ashamed our religion classic case throwing the baby along with the bathwater what they have failed consistently apply the logic other communities corollary that frustrated people see the posts critical hinduism and think well what new here knew this and made feel ashamed hey look the muslims circumcise but they maintain the secular fabric the nation has gone the extent that need create saffron terror more recently censor board reaction and msg most people take the internet highlight the inconsistency dealing with criticism religion ,-1
frankly don even get your logic the practice described that link yours sure nobody modern times have seen first ask you get people who seen firsthand and then let criticise all you want short was moronic post that caught attention only jokes ,1
hindus have belief that hinduism very very different from other religions and that lacks most evils other religions this could the result being juxtaposed with extreme sides islam under the mughals and after that for long long time regardless believe this has led hindus feel that hinduism infallible conversations with parents have all ended with them either being hindu apologists just flat denying the wrong that exists last conversation here with individual where tried argue that india isn backward because islamic presence resulted being called muslim with the person deciding that the only way could prove non religious nature atheist was each posted pornographic images muhammad and his daughter and hindu deities not that care too much about the religious pornography but was too stunned the lack maturity general civility that suggestion ,-1
atheist here and hindu don like call myself culturally hindu because frankly don like much and that was the first thing that came mind yes digressed from posting about that that post didn want create shitstorm ,1
hindus here and elsewhere seem have totally forgotten that the caste system still exists and that inherently unjust and barbaric heck even urban educated upper caste hindus wont marry loe caste dalit imagine the situation some tiny ass bihar village all religious people know have holier than thou attitude where they never ever acknowledge their own faults but chide others for theirs whichever way you look hinduism has major caste problem ehich refuses away and you are doubt tell your dad that you are marrying dalit girl then report his response here better still try being lower caste and enter temple some small bihar village ,1
 the proverbial straw that broke the camel back would this post sack bricks and has found the usual hindu haters whine along from the post that triggered this outpouring frequently symbolic defloration satisfied the requirements the reform pretentiously seeks has already happened ,1
 jain and honestly dont give shit dont get wrong think healthy discussion relgious topics essential call out obviiously stupid rituals antics people out cheat gullible people just that dont find myself being interested such discssions maybe its coz view more fatalistic religion just another way people group themselves every civilization and yeah thats including western nations groups itself amonst commonly held beliefs have strong opinions about those who dont believe their set values its trait any civilization and will present some form the other kill this there will something that will take its place there escaping you will always grouped into something whether you like not and you will possess some beliefs and characteristics that will offensive disagreeable wrongful the other person whether those beliefs are right wrong subjective and therefore can never been categorized into right wrong ,-1
you know hate when topic regarding hinduism islam and christianity make guest appearances this sub has many users who are either pseculars right wingers balanced discussion hard come yes islam needs reforms but does hinduism comparatively hinduism might more progressive than islam but doesn mean should lenient when barbaric activities like the defloration ceremony takes place hinduism not perfect one may hide behind but what about muslims when any criticism hinduism comes but doesn really change anything hope people stop comparing religions when specific discussion carried out about particular religion and talk about what wrong and what could done about the problems agnostic couldn care less about any religion but please islam needs reforms reminds this mods why did you delete the post regarding islamic reforms saying doesn concern india and does hinduism not comparing them the quantum reforms needed are different but yes discussions even hinduism should balanced edit added word ,-1

 however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right but many comments appear that justify harassment freedom expression equally outrageous the comments from the opposite ends the spectrum that justifies freedom libel slander freedom expression somebody had threatened murugan there absolutely defence for they need booked under relevant sections the law that however doesnt mean murugan had the right assosciate real world community fictious slanderous ritual and not expect those slandered pursue legal means redress the situation also dont know where you got the pulping the book the latest seems has agreed remove the portions the book associating the women with the fictious ritual and ahead and bjp rss werent the main protestors even the original protests were the kongu vellala koundars whose community women were portrayed negative way was only later that the hindu munnani joined them and perhaps you are not aware the actual flow events fyi regarding the floration few redditors from the nair community the community that was mentioned practising this have mentioned they havent even heard this valid question what separates libel from freedom speech are supposed defend libel under the defence constitutes freedom speech would like you clarify that ,1
completely agree regarding the ritual defloration understand that applies specifically tamils and again specifically the tamils traditional enough have coming age ceremony some don and again those who actually allow the priest conduct this ritual who assuming the minority many hibdus treat something that other and not part hinduism per but yes there are tons problems with hinduism and this sub reddit answers any criticism with look what the muslims are doing sickular which isn right must learn accept what dole out and don think comparing ourselves the muslims going make any better ,1
great post would add economic theory angle nda upa there was very public spat between jagdish bhagwati and amartya sen recently whether gujarat development model good one bad the red side amartya sen who has been proponent improving social indicators education illiteracy bottom approach sorts reckons that once people become more skilled they will start contributing the economy and accelerate growth the blue side jagdish bhagwati who has been proponent policies aimed accelerating growth reckons that acceleration growth will increase government revenues which can then used improve the quality life the peoples you look where nda and upa take their inspiration when comes economic policies then becomes obvious that nda more towards jagdish bhagwati and upa more towards amartya sen basically comes down choose your poison choose nda not because economic genius who thinks one better than the other its just that have tried one and has failed for nearly years lets give the other side chance ,1
 formatted all the tables thanks vim anyway copy your post and will delete the comment every second day there thread why educated people support that fount communal poison the bjp instead all endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff wanted take slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from nda era and the upa regimes even plotted graphs excel but imgur won allow upload excel graphs and have idea how upload these onto reddit otherwise ideas welcome also how does one make tables reddit copy pasting from excel again does not work the data indicator nda upa upa agriculture industry services gdp growth rates nothing much choose from though the upa seems have done well across all sectors how this achieved will cover little later indicator nda upa upa cad cad the upa performance looks horrible one could attribute increasing oil prices touched peak 100 barrel certain extent but only portion why the cad went down horribly indicator nda upa upa inflation wpi inflation cpi inflation seems have been horribly mismanaged the upa and this largely due deficit financing and pumping huge funds into the rural sector the form mnrega the mnrega was the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients drove prices over and hurt the economy whole indicator nda upa upa fiscal deficit again how did the upa achieve the funding such profligate schemes such mnrega the food safety act the loan waiver deficit financing essentially spent more which govts usually more than what earned this also has the side effect fueling inflation and now come why believe even these numbers are illusionary absolute increase employment nda upa agriculture manufacturing non manufacturing services total the net jobs added the nda years compared the upa data for 2013 was not available not even comparable and this why believe the upa growth was illusory jobless growth factor the million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and imperative that nation find jobs for all them another factor would have liked compare but data not available prior 2008 will leave out scope but just mention this the indicator gross fixed capital formation infrastructure the nda well know focussed lot infrastructure roads and the highway network being chief amongst these the nda added more roads years than years other governments combined without the govt massively investing actual infrastructure job creation and economic growth going difficult manage this not new either the upa mismanagement indira gandhi did pretty much the same thing she created import fueled bubble illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation windows opportunity memoirs economic adviser krishnaswamy goes into detail into how indira almost wrecked the national economy recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring the late indira also established the trend socialistic economy not her father who piloted mixed economy ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal banking wheat and imposing draconian restrictions the private sector indira also failed focus infrastructure and during her first regime cut down investment infrastructure after nehru who did very well guide the indian economy given his set challenges every succeeding gandhi dynast has been absolute disaster for the national economy the problem the gandhi congress way has now caught and almost every major party follows the same dead approach populsim throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics subjective opinion bjp see party that serious about building infrastructure that serious about creating jobs that while populist marries this populism with sense pragmatism arguably the only party right now that sees merit manufacturing being the workhorse the indian economy see how the bjp method has worked relative india course places like chatisgarh gujarat goa yes has failed karnataka yet has the resilience learn and apply lessons and not just throw some dynast scion continue the same tired old politics sloganeering empty tokenism and sops all won work without some hard reforms and this something the bjp has established track record and this why support the bjp source for the data the planning commission php data datatab edit seriously cross heart and hope die pinky swear level don care about points and self post doesn even give any points but seconds after posted this was wonder being brigaded the namo army edit somebody please tell how draw tables upload graphs here the post looks messy without tables ,-1
excellent effort thanks for the post was big fan the nda govt because was when was india and aware interested politics and their policies seemed make sense not sure some things can ever quantified your analysis 2008 recession for mostly because economics are not forte also did the sanctions that came after the nuclear tests have any effect ,1
 add some context most economies except are struggling the moment there massive that holding the similar efforts are also being made europe japan and china but have far had little success most currencies have lost massively against the but inr has held brazil was considered india peer and its economy the dumps and russia are struggling well though russia can blame some its tussle with nato ukraine the midst all this india stands tall you look the sensex its been going pretty steadily ever since became clear that modi was going come power oil crash has certainly helped the economy but the rise started much before that the criticism from some sections the society will continue matter how modi performs but doesn matter the big picture since the majority firmly behind modi the guy has the drive confidence and ability take our country forward fiis will continue pour money based fundamentals modi agenda was development and can already see solid results less than year ,1

 thank modi for one fact believe the brand image india has improved quite lot pretty much every single field will believe only stats once they are out but the improved brand image something can easily percieve and that give him due credit want ask something indira almost wrecked the national economy recklessly devaluing the currency didn china the same thing some few years ago continue keep chinese markets competitive with india brazil etc terms manufactured products and export import with regards exchange rates indira did the same thing only her timing was completely off there was way would have worked out then our favor but because that its good thing now ,1
 doubt upa did not manage the finances properly but the inflation during upa1 was also partly due the prevailing market conditions where rbi had for omo purchases which effect led inflation rbi reportedly bought bonds close 6lac crores during the period 2008 2013 but the indiscretion showed upa further worsened ,-1

 with raghu raj this one the fact that the bjp views manufacturing instigator growth not plus point ,0
inconclusive view time the best judge can really compare the post era this simplistically there was massive growth and movement the mid late because the level from which things started was low congress being historically center left party has always had socialist tendencies chose use the funds give freebies the section which was less developed vote banks etc the expense pumping that money into sectors such are infra health etc india not rich the mid india entire gdp was less than defense budget can spend use its money everything has prioritize congress choose what did only time will tell how right wrong they were when compared what comes after them current govt will also have prioritize because india while longer equal defense budget numbers still pretty poor terms its revenue can just pump money into everything and make things everywhere right that just not going happen ,1
you can make tables last control above the text box thanks for the post feel the same way the social side bjp make want throw but economics and defence national security where the degree patriotism actually measured there comparison the bjp least far seem run adults who understand economics while the congress full with some exceptions either traitors idiots ,-1

 actually trade any crota drops for the scout rifle with field scout and firefly don have necrocasm yet but did would trade well for the vendor scout rifle there really isn any loot that excited about ,1
more max rate auto rifle yay,1
 just want point out case one mentioned looks like the how gear going take everyone light instead tdb where you were with raid armor that became obsolete overnight with the base armor being released basically you were maxed with tdb raid armor then you don have buy rank all new armor you just need the raid get upgraded raid gear rank ,-1
omg that armor this turns out fake bungie needs hire this person because skills while glad bungie has announced that the new armor for how won make the crota end raid gear obsolete going swap out for the new stuff this legit ,1
ughghgh gorgeous new gear pics and all language can even pretend understand talk about cocktease,1

 destinytemp24 thoughts think confirmed but just that vendor gear the same song and dance tdb drop ,1
first legendary ever was pox volo wondered why was the only one using pulse rifle then learned the sad truth let rewrite that truth shall how all about high impact excited ,1
 someone knows how could they reformat this imgur gallery would greatly appreciated ,1
 what suppose untill may 19th ,0
may have wait until may for this dlc already out shit this game now have wait over months for something new this better not true,-1
can wait for raid shoes ,0
anyone else find strange that the gear starts light level surely this can right ,1
how was this done just changing the date your console may something ,0
 looks like all did was change the system date has anyone else tried this since someone used this view history xur inventory ,0
 hundreds meaning mostly new uncommon and rares that don have uses for ,1
 thought and sorry can source this right now they were raising the cap might hallucinating haven had full cup joe yet ,1
super depressing see that once again the vendors will make raid armor obsolete soon the dlc drops ,-1
looks like going start farming marks all characters and commendations grind the vendor gear goodbye set you missed starting 6am release date ,0
rofl looks like the queen should let shoot those fallen the reef when she had the chance well ,1
with the obligatory grain salt not sure why people are looking that new pulse rifle and chanting yay pulse rifles are getting fixed looks like the impact rating that gun par with the pre tdb super pox vlo sold the vanguard even with the high impact that gun making the best pulse rifle the game that time imo was still annoyingly under powered ,1
 guess tdb build contained placeholder dates for how the data hoping they are place holder difficult enough hold fireteam interest raiding right now with the expectation week wait month wait will kill this game bungie really need get response out for this one ,-1
not really liking the warlock helmets well usually have exotic that slot anyway the rest the armor looks good hopefully both sides the coat are intact what got for tdb pretty bad all for tatters but don rip off entire side the titan stuff alright again not liking the helmets the real question here why hunters get all the cool armor seriously the helmet gauntlets vest everything all looks amazing blood splatters may have finally make hunter when this releases ,1
this can legit the vendor gear for warlocks doesn look like hobo rags ,0
great post thanks can you post pictures the vanguard titan armor also please ,1
thank you deej for posting but dont think thats what are getting would like know the date the dlc thats the real kicker ,1
that scout rifle with field scout,0
 going pissed off you can purchase vendor gear that beats the best gear seriously did they not learn from their mistakes with tbd ,1
 issue with this that have wait months for what basically raid some story missions and some crucible maps will never play opinion know some people enjoy crucible and months mean since the precious expansion which was only raid some story missions and some crucible maps for any citizens payed ¬£ for both these the dark below was fairly lackluster expansion far expansions and lot was just textured stuff which seemed lazy know this seems like dissapointed with the game because content lol kind rant but more with what paying comparison what getting bought the season expansion pass very early because was naive about the game course still going check out the content but for that money could bought whole game what the new expansion seems key word seems running the information have heard offering the same the previous new weps armor missions and raid which for ¬£ the price without expansion pass just doesn seem worth that much feel like paying for bigger grind genuinely hope this isn the case enjoy the game extent but only extent can burn out this game quickly now avoid playing too much now hope how invigorates love for the game edit1 shoutout for this post btw good finds ,1
 the only one getting tired all the warlock cloaks being tattered messes ,-1
blood spattered hunter armor looks bad ass ,-1
wait did just keep setting his ps4 date forward until got these things glitch ,0
this stuff looks fucking sweet compared the dark below stuff,1
man hope they release how march because starting finally hit wall this game there are also some major new games releasing the spring and summer and much love this game time move without extra content ,-1
that scout rifle looks badass,0
would nice because not too much want know should save marks for next dlc buy stuff now ,1
see new pulse rifle feel scalp tingle time ,1
hunter confirmed master race with the blood all you other peasants its armor,1
 not fussed about weapons and armor there will always good weapons use and collect whatever armor takes higher light levels what interests about this post are the supposed release date later than expected true and the story from that first snippet sounds like the popular theories how turning against thee queen are likely true light levels believe someone recently quoted luke smith saying that they wouldn repeat tdb mistakes how reasonably confident that vendor gear won exceed armor having said that wouldn shocked new vendor gear matches armor which also arguably bad because makes the first two raids skippable ,1
can someone please talk with via japanese and translate every bit info accurately possible ,0
 the light levels here are correct new vendor max then you can reach 156 light level with just vendor gear soooo once again they are rendering all raid gear obsolete instantly sweet use grinding characters ,1
 bites lower lip yeah that warlock crucible armor freaking sexy going have start playing lot more crucible get ready for another average pvp player ,1
may fucking love this game but new content until may what the fuck the playerbase will dissolve then ,-1
tits just booked off the 10th march for the supposed release ,0
 looks like people can buy their way once again rendering the current raid armor totally useless,-1
 they need wait until may work out bugs and drop the best product ,1
this kinda anoyys like destiny but running out things and may gunna stop play then kinda disappointed,-1
man that helm sick,-1
doubt they will wait till may 19th will lose daily players too long wait already have lost decent amount ,1
must lie armor looks unique for destiny supposed the same models but with different names ,1
its march pretty sure ,1
the way see seems that accessing this data that has already been pre loaded meaning altering his console system calendar trick destiny thinking may 19th this explained his sentence turned out was may that house wolves was unlocked the game result analyzing this implies that had through each date until may 19th enabled the first date for access ,-1
 guess time grind those marks til max then just wait for this release ,0
could you show the titan gear ,0
that hunter armor ,0
 hope its not may thats long time ,-1
 don know this game lasts the next dlc comes out may people are already max leveled and ready for new content unless they plan spending these months fix all the bugs the end game content make actually challenging instead bug cheese fest ,1
the helmets are just reskins and slight variants each other again ,-1
lol alllllll loooks likeeeeeee shit sigh dammit man feel robbed ,1
 hundreds new weapons armor gear anyone else find the term hundreds weird ,-1
everything looks much scarier japanese also wouldn surprised all was pushed back may one they need more time get this stuff right and two they have long gap between now and september ,1
the only thing see high impact pulse rifle ,1
wow pretty armor and stuff like share here what just posted bungie net know that rampant speculation will burn for while this topic you enjoy conversation about the pearls information that can lifted from this please bear few things mind aside from giving name bungie has yet reveal the house wolves that means that anything you know about can change have team working the experience their own fancy room and they have some exciting surprises their sleeves reserve the right overwrite anything you looking right now these placeholder items enable save room your drive for actual future updates you all download them before time play any stats assumptions about power impact handsomeness are months old and not reflect the things that doing adapt what you taught about destiny there process here and you part leaks are fun totally get please discuss your heart content all ask that you leave your mind open the evolutions that are inevitable what you see here are very old ghosts from our pre launch database these are not the necessarily wolves you looking for edited for typo update gonna famous house wolves dlc leak bungie ,1

 wonder ever find out what union know tdb weapons are all the same colour scheme and share logo but are these weapons manufacturers what the deal ,0
the gear looks really nice far ,1
but what are the materials required ,0
 knew wouldnt march wayyy too much gap fall and noone believed would late spring early summer well there you folks ,1
 due out may need some activities the interim keep people interested queen wrath better coming out the oven and better last for few weeks with new stuff each week ,1
may seems really far away this true ,1
this guys mega hacker lol all the items seemingly took game screenshots are listed the database not photoshop expert but the pics seem legit also mentioned that was able see the weekly activities for many weeks ahead wonder can shed some light what can expect each week ,1
just seeing this alone way more content with how the armor and weapons look tdb love the way those hunter and warlock armor looks with the titan being least favorite look pretty excited for all new weapons with way better stats than what have now also pretty curious about those white union weapons ,1
 understand that this all very early information very prerelease and very hopefully likely change but the vendor gear does indeed once again invalidate all raid efforts release day and previous raids won buying again after this expansion pass used way ,1
shit dlc releasing may was told march that loooong loooong wait ,-1

the new armors feel lot more space agey plus damn crucible hunter variants are blood spattered,1
when have the actual names these sure add them the spreadsheet though these might placeholder stats these stats are near identical the crucible and vanguard weapons seen pre dlc the crucible machine gun effectively carbon copy the zombie apocalypse with new skin wait and see ,1
any pics the new faction gear ,1
 think this good lets bungie really focus getting expansion right this ultimately their last shot because the initial combination bundle people bought this dives then comet will struggle all the content shows will just placeholder and will massively changed the patch similar tdb content ,1
 this true love you ,1
 know there will crucible maps maybe the info here just reflection the original plan placeholder ,1
damn may 19th thats long time true especially with the lack content received from tdb bungie better amazing job with this dlc otherwise destiny will put down the controller ,1
woa where tis this from ,0
 will greatly disappointed doesn come until late may everybody was expecting early march,-1
 you have access the missions strike raid ,0
can you take screenshot the planets see where the new missions are ,1
that scout rifle looks dope ,0
 with waiting until may got some sort content update before then new patrols bounties strike something got 32s all the raid weapons and should have everything maxed out week after that nothing left ,1
anyone want champ and put all these into full imgur album ,1
 going start peaking faction rep each characters now faction packages release day sounds like pretty great thing ,1
 sounds like this was some sort datamining and then glitching create screenshots moreover the hot fix destiny using the system the console will delivered about four weeks from now does this mean you are analyzing leaked and beta patches that are not scheduled drop for another weeks nice you share whatever this with the community but think your tentative conclusion overreach which you put with question mark know you not claiming certainty the developers may have may the drop dead date for dlc release and uncertain will ready march intermediate step they moved the pre loaded assets that were already partially added later date avoid issues like that accidental relaunch the not yet retooled iron banner the stuff you show not necessarily final yet either stats and wording could easily changed they continue play test the dlc content house ,1
luke smith last week will not repeat the error vendor armor invalidating previous raid armor release today look pic vendor armor light ,1
 don understand much this but that fallen warlord looks sick can wait kill him ,-1
 the image shoes picked there evidence put like shakespeare,0
 the image shoes picked there evidence put god that sentence made cross eyed ,0
 basically proxified his connection and somehow forced the game connect the internal test server @ bungie guess this the only way have the updated events since everything managed server side now won get too exited @ everyone saying please push the content farther and don release until done etc imo done for very very long time since the game launched basically they just ironing things out and adding few requested feature such vault space but the content will 100 the same formula the previous dlc waiting for comet whatever the name which actually something they are actually developing but what sure that destiny just buffer fund the development destiny which will have wider scope and all sure major part the team now working destiny hence the lack weekly update and new contents ,-1

that seems really off ,1
most that old inaccurate placeholder gonna placeholder the same thing happened with the dark below lots people believed the datamined info and most was wrong this even less correct ,1
where the fucking anger about this disk dlc bullshit both the dark below and house wolves were done the day release what the fuck man where the fucking anger ,-1

 maybe thinking this too logically and not super smart marketing but wouldn the release plan have made more sense month increments mean get the christmas push but tdb could have used month polishing and then come out right when the christmas destiny players had christmas gift cards spend and the dlc and raids various quirks could have had some ironing again sure dec made sense someone but all did was feed hour addiction and unhappy customer base who are going wait even longer for the big installment not mention months enough time for all the casual actually play and appreciate the game which judging the 800 hours and hate this game and quitting the demographic still supporting destiny,-1

more than the this could game changer eliminating petty corruption which adds gargantuan numbers take the mnrega good scheme long the money reaches the target and there asset creation happening parallely various studies have estimated that only the allocated money even reaches the intended audience the rest being swallowed along the way this worse when comes pds the state governments and their netas and babus also get into the act where only the allotted aid reaches the poor said plan panel study pds recently found that only paise out rupee was reaching the targeted poor montek singh ahluwalia cms the pmjdy can used eliminate the leakages that have plagued every single scheme indian governments since nehru have launched for every rupee allotted poverty alleviation only paisa reaches the poor rajiv gandhi this fixed and can will quite literally game changer ,-1

honestly both camps are modi said his speech dharna karate hai unko dharma karne sarkar chalate hai unhe sarkar and had backed this with some anecdotes each person for different profession blah which logic would selling tea till now don get wrong really support modi and the best thing that could have happened ls14 but defies why bothered stoop low for delhi assembly ,1

 provides them with zero balance accounts debit card accidental and life insurance and enables direct benefits transfer their bank account that not the only advantage also brings lot money into the banking system which wasn previously there this will allow banks lend money businesses which will boost the economy further ,-1
jan dhan yojna another scheme drawn congress just like aadhar sorry stop taking credit for others work,-1
 not that kejriwal does not realize that bringing millions within the fold organised banking one the first steps towards improving the lives the poor and people living rural areas just that simply can not afford give any credit the bjp politician and cunning one that all claims party with difference had been laid dust long back you look isn very different from rahul gandhi the latter was criticising the made india campaign the other day asking people they got any jobs since the scheme was launched ,-1
 not possible for political parties open their funding for scrutiny anarchist concept for political parties protest and raise public concern over issues government incentives and tax benefits given corporations are good for economy but subsidies are bad but kejriwal cynic ,1
hey aren you the same guy who told die change job farming because complained against modi and called bullshit his promises increasing msp that forgot those promises after wearing narendra modi written all over his suit according you your taxes are wasted farmers haha you and your theories you self righteous arrogant disillusioned urban dude ,-1
 now said that they will give insurance one lakh which person will get after dies this one the stupidest things has ever said ,0
 think you have really big eyes only see the one thing the guy might have rhetorically said the comment was made rally masses put forth point not for intellectual people debating cozy homes sipping masala chai you think your love for modi will make him good there are extremely poor india report jan 2015 its totally fair get 110 the sitting mps campaign delhi that extreme poverty can solved cold blooded capitalist and maybe good time will tell but the poor arent getting any shit from him the time wrote this message adani wealth wud have grown another billion increased 152 months modijis blessing ,1

 all the schemes actions and statements the government chooses ridicule the one scheme does say the scheme should stopped not ridiculing the scheme but the governments hypocrisy you too are quoting out context sorry say this but you too sir are cynical piece shi ,-1
yes kejriwal most likely cynical piece shit but things stand now jdy crap simply lowering kyc know your customer norms things like overdraft accident cover and life insurance have been announced but has been some time since those announcements and progress has been those fronts ,-1
 chooses ridicule the one scheme that could free the most marginalised sections society from the clutches moneylenders how ,1
 wise man once told never debt bank you end working all your life for bank not know what really but think theirs least some bright side this scheme ,1
 jan dhan means public money but where the money its more like jan account yojana that the meaning the quote kejriwal ridiculing the name the scheme but you miss the whole point being love love with propaganda further creating accounts not big deal even before jan accounts yojana every bank was made open zero balance account for anyone who walked through their doors that was the law ,1
 did you see the survey results today the more poor person the more likely she will support aap aap like what the commies and congis used are into povertarian politics and their detriment people move their life hence the attack schemes that have the potential this not cynical just lowlife cunning piece shit ,1
thats 10500 crores what was unaccounted wealth far just becoming white this huge how know that the black money not already coming back india through these accounts which good know also has flipside even fraction being illegitimately managed called middlemen can rob unsuspecting ppl their money hopefully banks become more stringent aware about only account holders handling all transactions such accounts but sadly dont see any special regulations place did miss something ,1
this the problem with kejriwal isn sincere about anything all not even corruption ,1
more than cynical call him douchebag acting like the teacher pet dekhiye maine apna homework class mein khatam kar liya baaki students homework bhi aap abhi check kar lijiye kind crap great that you take initiatives and the whole world would appreciate you for your going over and above the legal standard for funding transparency but stop trying become the standard ask for votes the basis your transparency don call other parties names because you have suddenly come with arbitrary new formula ,1

well this the cost not giving subsidies all the polls show the bjp aap vote split along the class lines the aap benefiting from offering freebies way step back for delhi back giving out doles they have the cheapest electricity the country and still want for free they are going bankrupt delhi ,1
 have fear that these polls will watershed moment next years indian politics aap wins back the freebie style politics didi nitish bsp will try party with and have fear will agree yes aap supports will downvote and question proof but this just feeling personal opinion fear you might say power hungry sorry you dont like yes namo but the means and end goals are different slowly will turn secular that fear why because has already morphed from anti corruption leftist socialist and already showing signs caste class based politics anything which will establish aap national party will acceptable heck gave delhi just that could ride the holier than thou wave for the lok sabha elections that was the gamble was willing play can any sane person that and please you feel that left because lokpal you are fooling yourself why else did aap suddenly contest 432 seats more than bjp unless they wanted ride that sentiment anyways digress bjp wins not saying that all will great but according the only thing which matters for india this time establish itself manufacturing hub else our next generations are doomed and call centers will not feed the next generation already the current job generation years are feeling the pain stagnant salaries modi wins delhi his chances winning bihar karnataka and that important for him ensure that that make india successful cause that will his 2019 campaign you can already imagine and feel how important this glorified municipal election unfortunately this becoming fight between highly myopic freebies such free wifi against the long term plans for the country ,1
 giving nice interview right now she genuine person imo win lose please continue the bjp need more people like you also the interview was nicely done talking about issues the ground etc why didn she talk like this before the elections also don agree with aap their economic policy but did support them until elections despise them lot although will interesting see their year government congratulations them ,1
voted nota today the delhi assembly polls that said the bjp losing battle which they totally could have won the first aspect the timing the polls second their lack groundwork campaigning the months leading now aap has been working its support the city since the lok sabha elections while bjp looked like didn give rat ass the third aspect that will cost them the choice candidate which they made seemingly desperate move essentially few months back and with harsh vardhan the candidate campaign leader bjp would have been okay say this even someone who never votes for the bjp ,-1

this huge two ways this can bjp and modi realise that the whole hindu wimminz need have kids rhetoric ain helping shuts down and doubles down what his govt actually doing well but not the news much thanks the lunatic tards they double down the rhetoric this clear verdict and despite what the bjp might say personally read verdict the rather the loonies around him and saying these loonies are better than the owaisi etc don cut they are not power and with the best mandate any govt has been given the last odd years bjp supporter modi bhakth and one that doesn particularly care for believe aap political entity though this good because knowing modi and shah they will most probably the first this will help the upcoming assembly polls also enough being permanently campaign mode modi you have nation govern disappear from the limelight your mann baath etc though for good months let shah run the other campaigns and let your good work speak for yourself the aap supporters hope throws away his confrontational ways and not hold ceremonies give sheep growers 500 while the niti ayog meet like certain momta did edit fuck the congress fucking thugs being relegated irrelevance bjp supporters got that going for ,1
 views why bjp lost bjp did kejriwal what congress did modi excessive negative campaigning turds like sakshi maharaj and niranjan jyoti forgetting they were voted power for development and not for hinduttava inability bjp control excessive negativity some pro hindu organisations like vhp against minorities lakh was chunavi jumla probably that lakh suit won too sure about though one remembers modi was for years before being generally thought that poor chai wala has become straight away and this poor man suddenly wearing hugely expensive designer cloths coming power giving issue platter your opponents course kiran bedi the seasoned leaders didn take lightly wont suprised they themselves have sabotaged this election the first time she opened her mouth becoming candidate made think that was going tough for bjp congrats aap supporters more happy congress rout than being sad bjp losing this should wake call for bjp they should control themselves before too late edit additional inputs ,1
the evms have been tampered maybe now modi bjp will start reigning the ghar wapasi valentine day kids brigade voted bjp for the development agenda and the hope that modi will keep the right wing fanatics bay modi honemoon period over yet apart from grand exercises abhiyaans and speeches there little change the ground yes development things take time but right wing agendas various groups did not take long damage the bjp only hope the delhi loss does not make bjp match kejri extreme left wing freebies policies ,1

its landmark achievement because indian politics has been dominated dynasty religious leaders glamour film stars and rich businessmen for the first time popular anti corruption movement led middle class technocrat arvind kejriwal has successfully morphed into successful political campaign the ruling party led vicious election campaign targeting kejriwal and his family personally calling him anarchist and closet communist his party called the common man party has routed both power houses indian politics the ruling hindu right wing conservative party the bjp and the gandhi family led congress party which has ruled india for better part its post colonial history means small achievement and confident that future generations will speak kejriwal less terms they talk about lincoln and jfk today ,1

 great day for the indian democracy because for the first time newly formed political party was able defeat the two major parties congress and bjp state provincial level the aam aadmi party the common man party left leaning party that considers anti corruption well swaraj reactive policy making from bottom opposed top down core values now obviously these guys are not the messiahs they suffer from the same shortcomings other parties accusations corruption divisive politics excessive socialism leaning etc however the win important because sets future precedent for new parties form and stand seriously for elections country where people generally get into politics only because they either have family connections participated the muscle man existing leader have risen the top slowly over the years that the time they actually get the top they are disconnected from modern values this system discourages average guy enter politics because they wouldn stand chance against the old guard yeah hoorray ,1
this win very significant the party has members from what known middle class and lower class educated youngsters daily wages earner and more representation common man entering politics they should have won and they did always told clean dirty politics one need enter this win paves way for that had they failed would have been difficult for grass root level person muster the courage fight least people now know this also way ,1

 pretty safe bet that modi will down the best india ever had ,1
good job coal auction now what the timeline where all those behind the upa scams are jailed and the money looted returned ,1
the problem with these insane auction revenue that the money eventually comes out our pockets basically the government taking huge loan with emis and forcing the people pay back both principal and interest some private company that they have control over the low cost the licenses helped boost mobile penetration across the country from million 2004 375 million 2008 670 million 2012 the lowered cost calls from increased competition allowed poorer sections get connected despite the rupee plunging from inr 2008 inr 2012 ever since the licenses were cancelled the cost voice calls has gone multiple times spectrum was auctioned the highest bidder years ago and were supposed have 150 million subscribers 2014 but all managed was measly million and coverage concentrated the cities and most rural areas don even have the option using even they are willing pay for but all the money from the bwa auctions ended being spent schemes like fsb aaadhar subsidising loss making psus like air india bsnl etc windfall auctions are never good for the consumers large because thanks the huge amounts invested upfront which are usually bank loans taken the companies they try recover much money possible the earliest and that means higher prices for everyone until they start making profits the same thing happened with auctions europe where telcos bid massive amounts the auctions and then failed roll out networks and went begging the govt change the license terms and allow the operators share networks etc meet coverage goals these coal auctions are worse because the central govt allocates the coal blocks and all the money goes the states which may may not have actual use for the money instead coming viable development schemes that get funding from japan etc now the states will able spend all this money any hare brained scheme that the party power can choose promote and unlike spectrum where both the businesses and the end consumers are located the same area coal consumers are not necessarily located the state that producing them people other parts the country end pumping money coffers the coal producing states governments and will not even see the benefits the 15lakh crores that going collected from them edit here opinion piece pointing out other flaws the system the auctions 115021601818 html edit2 not defending upa practice handing out spectrum coal mines their friends just pointing out the flaws going with the highest bidder shows shortsightedness the part the government short term good for the govts the day may lead long term pains and losses for the country large more other reply ,1
 you won hear word this from our lousy media kya ece there are links ,-1
online auction very good initiative and also like the fact tht modi govt wants leverage the use tech governance which will increase efficiency and transparency considerably should actually follow the best practises around the world and modify them suit our needs tht would truly revolutionise the governance our country agree tht there has been lot bad press for modi govt and count myself bitter critic modi and especially the party represents but lot this negative criticism could have been avoided the govt had not shunned the media and actually spoke out issues their silence ghar vapsi nuisance actually very worrying the rabid elements his govt cud take advantage this govt reluctance speak out modi actually staking his reputation not speaking out controversies raked less than his cabinet and party members ,1

even though iit and iim students are not that much different intellectual ability than most indian student they gain lot having access resources most not have plus corporate leaders tend give more weight the brand value than actual results most iit students are now working managerial level counter this the economy need opened allow more companies set this will give ripple effect getting more

nationalities help set corporate india true there are people who have challenged the system and made the nation proud but considering the potential the great nation the numbers who swim against the

wheel hard escape from its clutches but you are one the lucky ones you hit the jackpot favors less talent but creates populace that again studies and henceforth become teachers again the system the system solely existing make reason for the system exist the first place pure science streams have eroded itself that level where the sole existence subjects like zoology and applied chemistry and physics now create teachers rather than aspiring scientists the situation worse engineering streams where almost the graduates are unemployable any industry fortunately streams like english

industry this needs stopped the alumni the most powerful organization that the university can trust blindingly alumni must involved each and every process the working the university helps the long run keep gold standard thesis works numerous shady companies have cropped which does for fee final year projects and thesis works students flock these organizations they can receive the final product with money rather than true effort this has curbed original thesis work should appreciated and awarded relevant training technologies can mitigate lack confidence students and help inspire original thought processes students must benefit from technological prowess available and competent guides who can guide them rote learning should avoided and learning should imparted seminar style topics must thought drill the concepts initially and then promote self learning through self made experiments and research most universities multi disciplinary research and thesis works are not allowed noted that the boundaries study subjects are blurry line and most topics overlap each other students and graduate research fellows must given the flexibility research multidisciplinary topics rather than stay within well defined dark boundary engagement programs universities must have the potential leverage industrial experts take talks relevant topics least twice trice week that can conveniently held after class hours not disturb regular discussion instruction hours the benefit this method many students benefit from actual industry working knowledge and multiple topics can covered during the same bell curve grading grading must bell curve that shows students and learning associates where they stand relation the rest the class rather than blatant pass fail grade that provide information service provider questions must engaging ones that simulate the critical thinking faculties the ward dissuade students from rote learning methods like open book learning and sheets with formulas and data values must provided the advantage such system that students will forced learn the concepts and move beyond industry real life are workers forced recall mundane equations and data values even its emergency situation critical failure component factory equations not help there experience and wisdom helps that achieved and made logical thinking processes usage technological tools for better learning are lucky live age where all information can easily accessed anywhere the entire wealth human knowledge now available through the power the internet hard paper back textbooks must shunned away and replaced internet resources and line well off line discussion groups periodic test and assessment should done and evaluated using line tools that can exactly pinpoint parts sections that particular student must concentrate this also helps minute tracking the learning process and make sure individual attention can given for certain students certain topics language proficiency this the most important and relevant need students and faculty must highly proficient english language now the facto standard for communication across the world has needed given more preference than regular topics communication standards for students across india abysmal its best english language learning must given golden place among primary learning centers and undergraduate schools our researchers and graduates suffer lot due their lack proficiency which immediately closes lot doors significant effort need overhaul the higher education sector india the usage relevant tools and methodologies must taken haste hasten development the national skill set copying blindly the process nations that may may not relevant and suitable our conditions may more harm than good but imperative the change and development has happen time already past make the changes rapid overhauling with vision the only hope make india leader highly competitive world ",1

 much ado about nothing for the whole wall text you gave two examples the documentary ban and maratha reservation per the official press release the government absolutely clear that the makers the documentary violated some terms the agreement the government the right they want take action against them for breach contract second even the terms weren violated why should any indian even agree with the blatant stereotyping indian males rapist minded being sick society beyond yeah sepoys have issues have serious issues but how does the stereotyping and the sjw mentality crying muhh oppressors solve anything you think before this documentary came most were support rapists and suddenly seeing got enlightenment how does the issue rape india gets solved the documentary being aired britain nothing changed for the positive while plenty negative things have the potential happen tourism loss negative stereotyping our citizens living overseas etc are all very real concerns that should considered this whole documentary just reflection how rape has replaced poverty the descriptor india the parts the western world that still sees india colony great britain and not sovereign developing nation that doesn need the white man woman teach them civilization and solve their problems and not posting this bjp supporter even kejriwal mamata rahul gandhi had taken the same decision would have supported them 100 simply matter being against false negative portrayal society culture and country regarding the maratha reservations what did you expect them yeah they won this time but still they have win the next time bjp had not gone ahead with the decision the previous government give marathas reservations the same group that castigates them now for this decision would portray them brahminical anti obc party rather the bjp gets the actual ground support the people who voted for them than the approval people who wouldn even vote for them for some other reason not this stop treating everyone who speak against you your enemies any examples that rss has always claimed that not political entity please make sure you keep them their place the same with vhp and and what did they fud much anyone needs take the high road its actually the appointed fossils rajya sabha who have made clear that the country damned they are just going block every reform move the government passes that years hence they can crow this government did nothing plus its been just months citizens india the mandate was for years stop this fire the ass impatience and the utter cynicism the government they are doing excellent job till now ofcourse they have some issues that need corrected but every indicator points that this will down one the best governments india ever had till now edit esteemed member randia lol you disagree state words not downvotes ,1

 here copy the judgment 1427183283 pdf you can add this the post 123 page judgement reading now and will post there anything worth sharing first the final judgement 119\ conclusion may summarise what has been held above section 66a the information technology act 2000 struck down its entirety being violative article and not saved under article section 69a and the information technology procedure safeguards for blocking for access information public rules 2009 are constitutionally valid section valid subject section being read down mean that intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge from court order being notified the appropriate government its agency that unlawful acts relatable article are going committed then fails expeditiously remove disable access such material similarly the information technology intermediary guidelines‚Äù rules 2011 are valid subject rule sub rule being read down the same manner indicated the judgment section 118 the kerala police act struck down being violative article and not saved article summary reasons cited section 66a freedom speech and expression under our constitutional scheme stated earlier not open the state curtail freedom speech promote the general public interest reasonable restrictions quoting from another judgement the right freedom speech and expression includes the right disseminate information wide section the population possible the access which enables the right exercised also integral part the said right the wider range circulation information its greater impact cannot restrict the content the right nor can justify its denial public order all these counts clear that the section has proximate relationship public order whatsoever the example guest hotel annoying girls telling ‚Äì this court has held that mere annoyance need not cause disturbance public order clear and present danger ‚Äì tendency affect viewed either the standpoint the clear and present danger test the tendency create public disorder section 66a would not pass muster has element any tendency create public disorder which ought essential ingredient the offence which creates defamation section 66a does not concern itself with injury reputation something may grossly offensive and may annoy inconvenient somebody without all affecting his reputation clear therefore that the section not aimed defamatory statements all incitement offence section 66a has nothing with ‚Äúincitement offence‚Äù section 66a severely curtails information that may sent the internet based whether grossly offensive annoying inconvenient etc and being unrelated any the eight subject matters under article must therefore fall foul article and not being saved under article declared unconstitutional decency morality what has been said with regard public order and incitement offence equally applies here section 66a cannot possibly said create offence which falls within the expression ‚Äòdecency‚Äô ‚Äòmorality‚Äô that what may grossly offensive annoying under the section need not obscene all ‚Äì fact the word ‚Äòobscene‚Äô conspicuous its absence section 66a vagueness quite obviously prospective offender section 66a and the authorities who are enforce section 66a have absolutely manageable standard which book person for offence under section 66a chilling effect and overbreadth therefore hold that the section unconstitutional also the ground that takes within its sweep protected speech and speech that innocent nature and liable therefore used such way have chilling effect free speech and would therefore have struck down the ground overbreadth possibility act being abused not ground test its validity section 66a otherwise invalid cannot saved assurance from the learned additional solicitor general that will administered reasonable manner governments may come and governments may but section 66a goes forever assurance from the present government even carried out faithfully would not bind any successor government must therefore held that section 66a must judged its own merits without any reference how well may administered severability the present case where has been held above section 66a does not fall within any the subject matters contained article and the possibility its being applied for purposes outside those subject matters clear therefore hold that part section 66a severable and the provision whole must declared unconstitutional article challenge found invalid the petitioners were right this article argument would apply equally all other offences created the information technology act which are not the subject matter challenge these petitions find therefore that the challenge the ground article must fail procedural unreasonablenes having struck down section 66a substantive grounds need not decide the procedural unreasonableness aspect the section section 69a will noticed that section 69a unlike section 66a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards first and foremost blocking can only resorted where the central government satisfied that necessary secondly such necessity relatable only some the subjects set out article thirdly reasons have recorded writing such blocking order that they may assailed writ petition under article 226 the constitution section being exemption provision closely related provisions which provide for offences including section 69a have seen how under section 69a blocking can take place only reasoned order after complying with several procedural safeguards including hearing the originator and intermediary have also seen how there are only two ways which blocking order can passed ‚Äì one the designated officer after complying with the 2009 rules and the other the designated officer when has follow order passed competent court the knowledge spoken the said sub rule must only through the medium court order subject this the information technology intermediaries guidelines rules 2011 are valid ,-1

 new year eve bunch medical students from punjab had booked few rooms friends resort himachal they apparently were doing heavy stuff their room one them overdosed and died thankfully friend didn get involved the legal criminal issues real problem punjab yes driving night state highways mdr not recommended most people avoid unless convoy trucks one can get waylaid druggies looking get some cash for their next fix ,1
 the bathinda muktsar area fix generally referred majithia majithia dayeen two majithias please haa nava majithia aya hai yes have the new majithia but the horse tranquillizer users have their own slang generally headed towards pre bhindranwale situation can expect social leader emerge from this over the next two years but the problem with this land that movements take religious colour and fast degenerate into something far worse than what they set out fix and the fact that the police also heavily involved this racket the most worrying thing ,1
 want say something about this but what should this depressing ,-1
slightly digressing from the problem punjab the rat pack experiment tried understand why people get addicted the first place here comic based the same experiment ,-1
 actually works pgi and pgi would always see the worst affected anyways story time relation mine was incarcerated faridkot jail modern structure now everyone enjoys drugs inside that compound from the inmates the police yes the police punjab the biggest conduit the drug apart from the fact they enjoy themselves they sell that the inmates afeem opium not considered drug most punjabis and lot respectable adults consume but guess this how gets started before astray you put drug consumer jail will come out with hcv say that because know people who have they get with needle sharing and jail jail people tend fall into rut when incarcerated who are the sellers the village women local police can not search village woman way hell you can that village punjab without using army police always selected from amongst the local population they would not act strongly expect them without hearing from relations and putting their own family immediate danger the whole drug menace complex think the first step should legalization which will not happen scrap that they can start not putting users jail they would come out worse have get back work but could work actively this desires ,1

 sorry say but you are using the drug menace political propaganda for aap clear from your note drug problems are clear and present danger whole india juvenile sentiments and bruce wayne approach does not solve punjab has been hotbed for cross border drug trade its one our strongest regions and sadly easy target for drugs from across the borders congress bjp and akali dal not have political manifesto for drug dealing contact rss you like they hate drugs and would help you but you were here just start discussion for aap then you are just like one congress bjp and akali dal use problems for political mileage ,-1

part you have something mind please let know canadian born and raised punjabi sikh university student working through the sustainable agriculture program have few other western born punjabi sikh friends the program well most have decided that after graduation will punjab work with higher education institutes ngo and other grassroots organizations promote sustainable organic methods agriculture among farmers punjab firmly believe that reversing the damage the 20th century green revolution absolutely necessary pulling punjab out its current dire situation only returning indigenous sustainable methods farming can punjab future food security protected modern yet sustainable methods agriculture would increase yield protect soil fertility water levels and stop poisoning ground water addition the above points sustainable agriculture virtue being more human labor intensive would easily open whole new world job opportunities for these unemployed punjabi youths who turn drugs because they can find jobs sustainable agriculture would also wonders for women rights punjab this system just does not work without female participation and empowerment one the biggest issues punjab today that the husband father brother son dies killed the women the family are plunged into poverty simply starve death because they don have the means provide for the family themselves but because women are arguably even more important for the success sustainable agriculture than men and play huge role making work provides women widows and single family households the financial security necessary feed themselves pay the rent and educate the children even the unfortunate case where the primary male breadwinner gone for more that please see these short videos z4ws9emhve4 awfrpx slua top securing punjab future ecological security and food security protecting the water our homeland providing young punjabis the means escape unemployment and empowering women perhaps sustainable agriculture greatest benefit that unified community effort builds strong communities strong neighborhoods and strong families everybody comes together make success the historical success punjab has

agriculture not only makes 21st century nations food secure but builds community strength and brings people together jrz34dee7xy local sustainable urban food systems could have even greater effect the land five rivers but the most exciting thing about all this that isn just confined the realm theory hopeful thinking there are people punjab who are following the sustainable path punjab today and reaping huge rewards for one such person the the organic farmer anandpur darshan singh rudel french born british national who finally decided make home punjab and converted sikhi darshan singh totally believes the idea and spirit organic food does his better half but when they bought the land nurpur bedi family and friends actively discouraged them from the organic idea everyone agreed wouldn work out remembers wryly but believed and went ahead question principles says the farmer produce healthy food and consumption organic food leads well ourished body the farm which has undergone whirlwind change since darshan took work looks transported from another country altogether the landscaping effect beams darshan singh punjab farmers have change their farming concept that don‚Äô want end with barren land our outlet here town have regular clientele and the number only increasing declares the rather reticent malwinder kaur who takes care the marketing aspect the farm but darshan singh rues governmental attitude the government does nothing for the few who are trying revive the fertility the soil fumes obviously there are people punjab already who are reviving the organic sustainable methods which have worked for thousands upon thousands years and they doing successfully think the best way convince people sustainable practices implement them successfully ourselves and people like darshan singh are living examples what possible when you put your heart and mind into the practice forget about two birds killing multiple birds all with one stone ultimately sustainable agriculture practices are something the punjabi people need start taking seriously again there seems very negative attitude our community towards agriculture like something only uneducated people would this needs change are ever save punjab from the dire situation think the reason that for the vast majority our parents grandparents did agriculture and they themselves are the ones who are pushing away from remember growing and hearing from father over and over again that the dream hurry and finish school get job accountant manager top bank the country sit air conditioned office clean environment and work for the hours and then home the wife and kids and that this what would make happy listened father and enrolled accounting university last year and dropped the class after month knew wasn for and despite what father may think not everyone wants sit around office doing paperwork all day now looking forward finishing sustainable agriculture degree and leaving work punjab with like minded people there someone out there reading this post who wants make difference punjab protect our ecology make punjab and hopefully set example for the rest india and the world food secure help end farmer suicide getting them out debt empower women widows and single family homes stop the use toxic chemicals which are poisoning our groundwater and causing rampant cancer among the punjabi population give unemployed youth life line get off the streets put down the drugs and bew able earn proper living for themselves and their families protect our diminishing water levels unite community living and strong families and transform punjab into one the most fertile regions the world then please note that never too late get involved this line work long you have the passion and plan intelligently you will succeed agriculture one field which will never stop being relevant there are people their late and the program university you want you can ,1

big time bad idea olympics have rarely contributed any kind positive effect the hosting nation ,1
bad idea they might even get since not many countries are interested hosting olympics has become very humiliating exercise last year norway pulled out cms 2022 winter olympics bidding because absurd demands from ioc officials the ioc hotel must rated either four five stars higher rating than any other client group the olympics the ioc hotel must offer full international hot breakfast buffet for two occupants for each room included the room rate catering services for ioc events and hour room service the hotel must have members lounge used exclusively ioc members there members lounge the hotel has install one their own cost doves must released after the parade athletes but before the head the olympic organizing committee speaks the opening ceremony signs around the city telling people where should san serif font and conceived part the look 100 security screening passengers and their baggage required prior entry into the ioc hotel this not requirement other hotels the venues must designed such that ioc members and guests are segregated from press and broadcast personnel every ioc member gets plus one the opening ceremony ioc members must greeted smiling positive and welcoming staff the airport starting two weeks before the olympics there are street vendors allowed ioc meeting rooms must air conditioned degrees celsius the ioc hotel must make available extra cost existing sport facilities such fitness facilities swimming pool and sauna facilities all ioc hotel guests and ioc staff members private cars must provided select ioc members the expense the olympic organizing committee volunteer drivers for ioc members must speak fluent english french and available work hours day for six days week plus ioa fucking dirty organization even ahmadabad gets should keep ioa barge pole distance avoid repeat cwg ,1
 seedha olympics and that too ahmedabad not cool modi not cool ,-1
don worry guys not happening many cities like rome hamburg and boston have showed serious interest hosting olympics 2024 edit also rome italy hasn hosted since 1960 they have high chance winning the bid hamburg and boston have never hosted and they also have higher chance than india plus this isn even serious yet dhondu just chiiillll ,1

white areas are regions frequent cloudiness dark areas are frequently cloud free few things about earth climate are immediately obvious lots cloudiness along the equator earth intertropical convergence zone itcz all the extra sunlight creates warm temperatures and general rising motion leading cloud formation the air rises significant drop cloudiness degrees latitude the called horse latitudes all the air that was rising the itcz gave its moisture clouds there and has back come down somewhere this causes general descending dry air the horse latitudes which why there are lots deserts those latitudes the southern jet stream doesn have much stop other than the speed bumps new zealand and tierra del fuego this tends isolate antarctica from the rest the climate making very cold and very dry which why antarctica the largest desert the world ,1

 the weightage allocated cereals and pulses alone double that oil this the most interesting bit your post any comments the appropriateness weights attributed different commodities ,1
 add this not only was upa hoarding grains etc came the point that were very suspiciously importing onions import onions curb fresh spurt prices html there further pushing the country down the gutter ,1
hey rajarajac great fan your posts you have once again raised some very legitimate points here however feel that you are playing down the impact oil price inflation bit remember economics lessons correctly the argument goes that the price oil directly impacts the cost transportation goods and lesser extent the production electricity thereby having cascading effect the prices pretty much everything transport consume not sure about how big impact there due this relationship but this theory does seem reasonable for further reading asp this not discount the argument you have made food hoarding for that ,1

edit lol sanghi bridage downvoting with all their might posting this edit for the few people who expand the comment the frivolous and inaccurate not talking about the upa thing posted all that could spot and not know about the starting though completely wrong food prices are always correlated with oil prices and this happens for many reason transportation fertiliser production etc well know economic fact that not yet seen refuted the arguments the contrary seem you have numbers showing this don but neither does the have numbers stating the opposite that oil price decline did not contribute the fall inflation take the other stuff you will but honest opinion the statistics bullshit oil prices are and always have been huge factor food inflation economics 101 comment the upa hoarding though while may have been big factor oil prices were definitely more than just minor factor according most estimates oil and other fuels accounts for cost food production trying imply that oil prices are only fraction food inflation bullshit fact this food beverages and tobacco rural urban combined fuel and light rural urban combined basic maths dictates that item has weightage the key driver inflation while something with overall relatively insignificant important but not the driver complete crap that weightage contains oil prices built into the statistical term you looking for serial correlation where the supposedly independent term are actually correlated with each other ,1
 posting again here since you keep bringing this childishly dense claim wrong net inflation affected the price oil and hence food inflation well the numbers aren going disappear just because you keep your eyes shut tight source inflation,-1
 add the above there were multiple other steps that controlled inflation 360 degree approach aid the bird brain memory the masses and media off the top head soon was elected may 26th itself bjp brought potatoes and onions under the essential commodities act the face sever protest from vested interests brings onions potatoes under essential commodities act html govt brings onions potatoes under essential commodities act the decision will prevent hoarding will place upper limit holding stock wholesale traders and others the decision taken the cabinet committee economic affairs ccea will impose limits the quantity onions and potatoes that individuals and wholesale traders can stockpile the move will also empower state governments take measures prevent hoarding ‚Äúdespite adequate availability there has been increase prices onions and potatoes there have been also complaints hoarding ‚Äù law and telecom minister ravi shankar prasad said ‚Äú want assure all citizens that our government committed reduce prices ‚Äù said within the first month assuming power bjp set 500 crore price stabilization fund control inflation the production end perishable commodities starting with onions and potatoes growers themselves can avail the funds that doesn impinge the markets but aids the farmers ece the psf will used advance interest free loans state governments and central agencies support their working capital and other expenses procurement and distribution interventions for such commodities the ministry said statement these commodities will procured directly from farmers farmers‚Äô organisations right the farm gate mandi levels and made available reasonable prices consumers ,1

prakash singh badal getting padma vibhushan the second highest civilian honour the country lost faith modi government after that ,0
 read this brilliant article pratap bhanu mehta great deal agreement though few things have changed since modi became and large the article holds good even after almost years few points from the article for all the hoopla over reforms the development models all political parties look pretty much the same the particular differences are due the timing and context when they were power both are incremental reformers both reform largely when impelled crisis and the variations their stances are variations circumstance not conviction both believe the rhetoric the poor first both have roughly the same approach institutions they are instruments used those power not instruments protect against them there actually more fierce contestation and blocking decisions precisely because there much underlying agreement when there deep consensus the ground the conflict longer disagreement ,1
not bjp supporter the problem have with people justifying this changing for the better that bjp going stick congress policies what the point voting them every criticism bjp govt gets you responses either congress was worse you anti national the opposition currently congress easy pick any point they raise why didn you this yourself bullshit the two parties keep flinging shit each other for the same actions the same issues while common voters get taken for ride honest was happy under congress rule there was much less vitriol the govt communication there were govt cheerleaders the ruling party didn make their supporters feel like victims secularism think said this before and say again rather live with scams than communal hatred ,1
bjp different from other political parties india when comes shoutfests and posturing the media when they are opposition and compromising when they come power also believe that any political party should pragmatic their approach and stands have changed according situation turn today would have been the wrong turn years ago another point noted that modi was not the helm bjp when many these statements were made his personal stand might have been different and since power has the ability change these sees fit still there are many disappointing turnarounds that said here take since promised the major hangup according the article before was regarding the guarantee supply and tracking nuclear fuel indo french deal ece has pretty much guaranteed lifetime supply for french reactors what this would mean that other nations would have follow suit will lose out against the french henderson brooks major fuck they should make public but believe there are few major bomb shells there that making the govt hesitant the same hold trues for subhas chandra bose fiasco well aggressive posturing for vote bank but the basic theme has not changed calling sharif for inauguration was good move gave diplomatic leverage pakistan issue something have live with only thing government can increase covert ops strengthen intelligence and speed arms procurement something parrikar has been doing quite right after years fuckups afspa still effect its draconian law and should used the right proportions the after article mentions that bjp will govern such way that afspa will longer needed turn here they never advocated for permanent afspa see the major issue raised bjp during that timeframe opposition was that they did not take the opposition into confidence secondly the illegal immigration from bangladesh has reached its heights bjp wants cut down that and dealing with exclaves the first step that process retarded oppose opposition definite turn that would support uma bharti talked about years you look the years plan talks about short term changes years medium term next years and long term next years there are things happening the ground level example phase clean ganga campaign completed 201 html definite turn and something don like aadhar and uid has been badly managed but the other option let the 1000s crore spent the project pragmatic approach would have been audit check the discrepancies the system modi was against not giving fitting reply ceasefire this time around the response was not something mild 1272821 aspx has bjp said anything about not giving delhi full statehood whats the turn here bjp supported the old bill and wanted changes that 2015 they are proposing new bill with changes that they see fit will reply the rest later you fill them ,1
whoa quite list there you have but despite these turns still with them for these five years the bjp govt isn doing any good for the country they thrown out without shame the next general elections let see what happens ,1

yes delhi turning out the achilles heel for bjp think they see but giving into would bigger morale damage across the country think about this way that they agree his demands easily their image will get bashed across the country better for the matter reach the courts and then the courts will rule aks favor and bjp will oblige think they view much more honorable defeat and you say the man the streets doesn care all knows wants something bjp not allowing courts allowed now will bjp losing brownie points but only delhi and frank enough they not care about delhi anymore and why would any political party care make easier for the winner when they were defeated unceremoniously ,1
 forget the legalities for second think the people the man the street doesnt know what the law states this same for subsidies the common man doesn understand why subsidized gas and electricity are bad does that mean shouldn remove subsidy culture for once think bjp right they have 5years let them what they think right for the country they could have easily encouraged subsidy and other popular bad decisions and save their seats for life but they have chosen not ,-1
 the man the street you need give him good roads electricity control local food prices the local man doesn give one single fart about anything else daresay that the overwhelming majority the electorate this country didn even vote out the upa because scams and shit but more because they failed provide roads and control food prices now don live delhi don know what the mood like but reasonably certain not very different from what described above ,1
kya spacey phir chalu karwa diya tune mudi mudi khujli khujli sale dono dono aisa chat hai mudi aur khujli jaise ice cream chat rahe ,0
its time people delhi need get out their city and realise what country thinks their drama queen most people said same thing when did same drama during lokpal only lost his face that time ,1
sorry the law the law kejru can fuck himself out the points the state list are with union government what stops kejru from working the other choot,-1
 agree with you there another aspect kejriwal loves drama all this protests make him even more popular bjp inadvertently making him even more powerful which good dear bjp keep ,1
this jung thing disaster for bjp should have left kejri alone could have failed his own anyway bjp just created more aap fans they are acting scared aap ,1
 isn bjp should stick the constitution and call kejriwal bluff high time the called clueless average voter learns bit civics lessons otherwise easy get convinced parties like aap congress rjd etc which work the low information voters bjp should stick informing the voters what happening and ask kejriwal take walk does pondicherry even chandigarh one would give rats ass ,1
modi sat his office staring out the window the sprawling gardens 7rcr everytime looked out reminded him how hard had worked get here from selling tea the railway platform the most powerful man the country the journey had been interesting one always believed that wouldn have been here were not for some divine intervention his faith lord rama was unwavering till yesterday but some things had changed overnight which made him question his own beliefs the first time became was sheer luck was the right place the right time keshubhai patel health was deteriorating and they needed replacement modi had worked towards gaining favor with the right people within the rss much that could give them ultimatum that either gets the top post the state doesn get anything all somewhat reluctantly the leadership anointed him the gujarat after that there was stopping him won one election after the other despite being blamed for not doing enough prevent the 2002 riots won the election that followed almost immediately modi knew the pulse his voters and knew that his core constituents will not give two hoots about the riots was right won twice more 2007 and 2012 then finally 2014 got shot the top post and his electoral victory streak continued even there modi turned around and looked the indian express spread his table the full page headline and picture announced the victory arvind kejriwal aap the delhi assembly elections shah had called him give him the news their impending defeat day before counting began his sources already declared that aap was going win although they couldn pinpoint how many seats they will get the headline blared modi had not felt such burning anger long time his winning streak was broken man who protested the streets puny activist was one the same breed people who hounded him for years about the 2002 human rights violations all his political life had fought these called civil society members getting rid them any way could and now one those activists had defeated his party the most humiliating way possible modi received text his phone was from shah hausla rakhiye abhi toh jung shuru hui hai ,1
second this don know why bjp being confrontational give some freedom the state govt govern ,0
don think the people already have their biases set just look this thread for the two sides the opinion the guy who supports finds out way convince himself how bjp playing spoilsport and for the guy who was anti begin with this just reiteration him being drama queen ,0
 forget the legalities for second and meanwhile the delhi also ruled kejri favor about acb see ,0
 will leave cents about this whole issue here opinion bjp fears aap will become national phenomenon the whole mess started when delhi election got waaay more national attention than should have was almost like modi kejriwal bjp was flying high moral was high congress was humiliated and bjp thought was this historic moment where can cement its government for long time but aap got way too much national attention hell people were almost excited the national election for the delhi election and the win pretty much shocked the entire country lot people did see they won with that margin they must doing something right modi wave over aap tsunami sweeps delhi was all over the media bjps momentum was brought grinding halt sure that same day bjp decided make work for aap hard possible this not new the when obama became president republicans pretty much openly declared they are going block every action the president and not let him work also this success seemed have gone aap head and they fucked several cases modi biggest fear aap delhi may become the new gujarat which won modi 2014 election aap did very well going national phenomenon aap has backing the urban middle class they get into other sections they can real danger but this new lows from the bjp let aap function the way they want they fuck let people vote them the fuck out like congress also please dont give aap anymore excuses they can come with bjp does not let this not our fault just let them they screw atleast they cant blame the bjp wish more people get this dont owe anything the bjp aap congress should have zero loyalty any political party just vote for someone who you think will the job they dont vote someone else need stop being emotional about political parties they play with our emotions our loyalty only this country bjp not 100 right aap not 100 right congress not 100 right citizens aim get combination government opposition out these get the best governance aap and bjp make each other insecure and make them work harder good for rant,1

 answer would either lost this torrent intellectual discussions heavily downvoted you know whom could not resist the temptation here pure lay man these are the points why will again and again favour the bjp which had been doing right from school days even when whole family was for only the congress every one family has availed the insurance schemes that the government has offered very easy fill these forms have recommended this maid servant and every body that know off why the previous government could think such schemes for only selected communities what irks now the whole nation benefits feel this awesome scheme and going benefit very much from these not work big mnc the service sector way back 2004 knew that there would whole sale conversion christianity our country happened too not have any thing against that religion infact visit the church quiet often love jesus his zealots that abhor but detest the fact that nation losing identity culture and its great glory tradition and philosophies sonia and her children will definitely silently insidiously turn countries illiterate mass into the religion they were born continue asking quiet few young adults about their political views live bangalore perhaps this phenomenon only here but the all whom ask are totally for bjp the most favorite comedian among youngsters not johnny walker vivek anyone else rahul gandhi you know what the young people say why they are pro bjp bjp might corrupt but they are corrupt while they contribute but this vice versa for congress what they say edit one day might vote for the aap any body else but never ever for sonia and her children ,1

 unnecessary controversy which could have avoided many people including our media will only derive one meaning from which women support terrorism however the other meaning which immediately comes mind that tough for women against things like religion terrorism bangladesh given how taslima nasreen was treated must difficult for women express their opinion freely about things like religion terrorism lets not think about terrorism here from indian perspective remember that what call terrorism what many hardliners well commoners pakistan bangladesh call struggle for freedom ,-1

there were few blunders the whole speech let our own dreams shatter that bangladesh could prosper something that effect pakistan naak main dum kiya hua hai while watching the whole speech imagined worried mha officials working furiously preparing clarifications the was speaking rather like modi unprepared and extempore way speaking however often unable speak coherently and talks speaking his living room where goof ups are allowed because likes talk informally needs very careful when speaking such high level ,1

 agree the should not have wear his patriotism sleeve same for all muslims the country there are some bad apples but there are many others that don side with the stupid fanatics similarly modi doesnt have come out every single time and admonish idiots who are radical hindu rss side for even though wish did because considering the questions his past and his standing the leader has coming out and saying this not right but imo simplying tad bit let call spade spade there lot shit that goes the muslim side muslim law board and lack ucc come dude that effed either are secular state are not shout out for goa the only state the union india with uniform civil code there doubt bias india against muslims unfortunate but exists and that manifests itself many ways how people interact with muslims etc sometimes feels like vicious cycle speaking folks the courts and the prisons not problem that limited muslims alone somewhat factor the messed judicial system draw parallel with caucasians and african americans the there inherent bias based what have read against african americans and there might something similar indian setups definitely worth looking into but would look for some data making sweeping statements makes you somewhat guilty even discounting your rant tone speaking like the idiots you rightly ridiculing ,-1
unfortunately this exactly what you will get with the bjp this party that largely came prominence after its leaders participated the demolition the babri masjid and have continuously spewed rhetoric against minority religions india modi used blindly spew the same rhetoric this the same person who referred post godhra refugee camps for muslims baby making factories used the term hum paanch hamaare pachees refer muslims both generalisations that have basis fact however modi realised that project himself prime minister cannot project his hatred result shakha indoctrination directly therefore the run the elections completely avoided the topic religion and personally focused development however other party members threatened send people who didn vote for modi pakistan spread fud about love jihad divided people into haramzaadas and ramzaadas and other such general nonsense the fact that these luminaries were rewarded with ministerial birth being made charge elections state tells you all that you need know about bjp remains bigoted party borne out bigoted and sick movement hindutva whose only aim ensure that india regresses socially into hindu theocratic state where other religions live second class citizens are shipped off other countries unfortunately due lack better options had make deal with devil gave simple majority bunch old farts with extremely regressive social views let hope that enough social fabric left the time these guys are done with our country ,-1
you should have included this disclaimer from your own comment history just clarify muslim having allergy for modi brigade comes naturally once the dictator loses elections and minority pleasing congress comes back power you will gain faith the idea india again not you just might settled the foreign country you are now why would you care about india then anyway whichever way look don see why should actually look deep into your post ,1
good point our govt hinduistic nature hence they use that weapon politicize and secure vote banks just like congress uses minorities will not have major effect common man calm down ignore media based propaganda and live happy life ,1
you need relax man these things will blow away now lets try have reasonable discussion you start your post saying your faith the idea india going down the idea india this idea that insults the traditions the hindu majority this idea which has subverted the the minds the people this nation such extent that the mere act taking pride country past called communal introducing sanskrit studies called saffronisation this idea which doesn work towards national integration but divides the country into many distinct identities possible using religious caste class faultlines this idea that celebrates socialism and keeps people poor poor for fucking years resulting the lowest low indians who are used slaves the gulf and other lands this idea which insults hindus and their age old traditions philosophy and their scientific acheivements this idea which course celebrates secularism yes this celebrated word upom which reams and bytes words have been written which course has nothing with equality religions and lets face can islam and christianity really call themselves equal other religions that would blasphemous only the deluded and foolish hindus who keep parrotting all religions are equal sorry say but this idea time has come consigned dustbin new idea being created which will celebrate our hindu buddhist past the countries south and south east asia once looked upon india their mother civilisation the chinese upon death wish the souls their departed west india that they can peace with buddha the japanese used call tenjiku the people heaven this idea that will celebrated india profund gifts the spiritual world will celebrated 2014 and modi election was merely the final nails the old idea india but the hindus had already started becoming more assertive earlier internet brings all kinds information and india develops more people will discover india past and rightfully proud being part the world oldest and only continous civilisation the romans greeks mayans persians have all been consigned perdition the chinese have profound hindu buddhist influence the chaiwallah puts india towards path growth the country should the world 3rd largest economy decade the other points you raise are mostly political but here too much the blame can put the muslims much bjp when hindus are ethincally cleansed from their homelands muslim came out protest raise voice against them when yoga day was being endorsed 160 countries was the seculars and some muslims our own country opposing just final point pakistan and bangaladesh are muslim nations carved out india specifically that muslims can have their own lands india secular constitution but hindu buddhist its ethos and culture its the hindu majority that provide stabilising influence their core philosophy live and let live deny them the right celebrate preserve and propagate their culture will met with increased resistance going forward these are intial stages the motormouths bjp rss may come across bit too hot things will cool down and say look forward ache din the buddha has started smiling india now ,1

because celebrating anything hindu opposed muslims and christians alone when did sikhs jains tibetan buddhists have problem with hindus the persecuted tibetan call india home and have never faced any discrimination hell they have settlement karnataka all the places but when did you hear that tibetan buddhists and hindus were rioting always muslims and hindu who riot and then this squarely blamed hindus the reality islam needs substantial reform and muslims should step and work towards rather than being stuck with this 7th century mindset ,0
okay but you realize that the well was poisoned islamists who have always put religion ahead nation country ,1
idea india lol,1
personally think that this whole muslim apologist thing has been created the media and has gone far enough you should look certain businesses that only muslims run and hindu never into them like leather meat bakery etc then why don you say muslims are victimized and frankly the western media that doesn want hindu muslim peace indians don really care except very few which are there all religions whether someone hindu muslim this wedge created the british unfortunately has lasted till today and due backward thinking people will last longer high time that people realize that most indians hindus aren discriminating based religion ,1

scams his party his party chouhan government helped unveil the scam creating committee that did the investigation the scam scam that has been going for the past years they the wrong let fight this but least show something substantial other than the inability handle such large case which should dealt criticising and working with the government help resolve its incompetence rather than throwing baseless accusations which think would more accurately described hopeful dreams conspiracy theories because accusations least have facts this entire accusation was started digvijaya singh trying get political points against chouhans bjp government used evidence provided him whistleblower against chouhan which turned out forged but that was settled but the outrage wasn apparently again never attribute malice that which adequately explained stupidity last remember using the same aphorism many times was truthers ,-1

 agree with all your points but for child born 2015 just does not matter how india was 1947 what matters the probability getting good education and health care that can grow become competitive adult unfortunately lot children born this year will still malnourished illiterate and disease afflicted this unacceptable even comparing with 1947 the absolute number children who suffer more because population has increased fold while wise could better the reason why people complain because progress not line with our potential our human and other resources remain untapped and wasted not skillfully channeled into solving the problems still lose obscene talent brain drain mainly because government apathy that why complain not because not progressed from 1947 but because could done much better and more importantly the problems why did poorly still remain unfixed corruption culture and still slows progress compared potential realise that our children will face same problems and that frustrating fair both sides need list areas where pathetically failed our universities are terrible public policy making not based research government primary education system same for decades government hospitals and public health care shambles still have malaria typhoid diarrhea while abolished many countries progress painfully inequal across states and are helplessly electing idiots power many our friends have chosen emigrate out those countries that are 100 200 years old and have made getting card those countries their career goals and succeeding whoever chose stay back are being shown that our decision stay put was bad ,1
yeah too much negativity the problem with our exposure the western world have adopted casual disdain for our achievements are just years old compared western nations who are more than 100 years old also forget two important things when compare ourselves with china aren homogenous nation like china extent still live democracy the biggest democracy compared their all encompassing communist state ,1

 agree but like point one more thing that had not been for inherent corruption all level called functionary departments would least years ahead what are now lakhs crores till now has been funneled into the pockets corrupts instead being spent development nation imagine every paisa least majority ever put aside for national development was spent the purpose was truly intended for how developed now network roads electricity and water lines not only small towns but majority villages all across india enough storage for our food grains lakhs tons which rotten rains every year better education education system now place not adequate any sense and doesn invoke creative and rational thinking its just rote learning exams put more emphasis learning stuff and solving question rather than understanding concept and applying real world problems degree has more value than skill upto level ofcourse and much more not countering you but feel ourselves are responsible for the condition had have now and the one who were are supposed guide the uneducated ones and show them way toward progress were are the one who chose choose misguide them and even use them for their selfish insatiable desires but not right compare two nations with developed one with developing one each one has its own history and plethora issues hidden behind their nice shiny cities and hopeful that with right steps right time still have much potential march ahead thnks for the patience while reading this ,1

same thoughts especially after reading couple books india after gandhi and india unbound should also take pride institutions like iit iim that are well regarded and established isro another great scientific achievement along with our nuclear program wish your post had more concrete points though another great point that decade ago think most would stand line buy train tickets you were well off tell travel agent now almost everybody books tickets through irctc and stumbled upon the train booking office yesterday and there was barely any queue extension this post should also list out concrete improvements like see various aspects india years from now for example our per capita income should increase that govt procedures still riddled with corruption like lease signing etc digital possible that our government schools now register 100 attendance and churn out excellent students who become successful doctors engineers ,1

 another child the while admire your perspective and trust your facts your narrative not convincing forward movement itself given for any society when you consider years there period indian history where there hasn been forward movement over that timeframe even including the worst company rule what drives emotion the rate forward movement india share world gdp was not the lowest 1947 but 1990 just before pvn liberalization kicked when compare the rates right before and after obvious that years were wasted there also doubting that the current productivity the indian population continues stifled albeit with looser noose you assume indian identity after 1947 monolithic but think bimodal distribution closer reality the incidents goonda raj and wanton crime you mention may have occurred the hinterlands somewhere but the metros were nothing like growing sub metro part the educated middle class experienced none what you describe city bangalore was wonderful the police could trusted hell even the auto drivers were nice ask feel happy because bihar has fewer booth capturing incidents bit rich you sound like those people who ask happy because india didn turn out like the congo when know the country had everything become europe you paint overly dark picture the 1947 the 500 princely states line much bandied but little more than theatre the british provinces and the largest princely states mysore hyderabad baroda and held 250 million the 300 million inhabitants india aside from these only others even had state government the administration the country was quite robust and had been for hundred years then the prophets doom who said india would disintegrate were more credible than their descendants today who claim that india going fall apart any day now because maoists operate full india 625 districts any field from business tatas birlas cipla you know this one science the arts india was bunny 1947 there absolutely wonder that produced swaminathans krishnaswami ramaiahs and ramachandrans the wonder that there were few the examples power cuts bigger highways faster kiosks pay electricity bills like presenting figures peanut production growth and asking feel proud don recall ever thinking that powercut long queue pay the power bill was major concern and doubt you did either ,1

weird think your friend the grip cult out curiosity who this jain guru does not consume any allopathic medicines western medicine medicine that proven safe and effective will just refer medicine henceforth allopathy this unfortunately not uncommon opinion held india mostly because low levels education and low levels availability medical services but thankfully its dying out doesnt have much with jainism you will find people all religious faiths spouting this nonsense india indian produce better not grown with many chemicals and this actually somewhat true because the west most food has been selectively bred with the purpose extended shelf life food also transported over large distances which means doesnt ripen the tree which makes the flavors not good they could but blanket statement wrong and things are changing india too what can ask his guru ships disappearing over the horizon question good because you can actually see the curvature the earth the spherical shadow the earth causing lunar eclipse another question germ theory another question but doubt anything you ask would make any difference cult leaders are very clever sociopaths who construct alternate reality lure vulnerable people their trap they are fully cogniscent that they are committing crime and may even assault you continue their empire ,1

this just being overly dramatic the ramblings the uae foreign minister few months ago about the yemen participation pakistan was just done pressure pakistan into completely aligning with the gulf uae does not and will not make political statements that aren backed the rest the khaleeji countries suggest that uae pursuing more india focused diplomacy political future not true true from purely business perspective which happens the only thing uae rulers care about terms india pakistan relations the whole gwadar port business has pissed off these city states and they are pressuring pakistan abandon since will hurt them economically the use such politics just mask the real issue they have with the port the vague and contradictory stands pakistan and turkey are absolute proof that arab security ‚Äî from libya yemen ‚Äî the responsibility none but arab countries that statement cute the gulf arab countries have always relied pakistan for their security and have been the biggest contributor besides usa their protection have been training their previously non existent armies and are still doing that india will always try undermine pakistani interests but there reason believe the gulf will turns towards india other than for business they simply cannot that even they wanted ,1

 bjp just bad the congress some cases worse that what you are trying say because that what looks like ,-1
quite the eye opener this why harbour such disgust for liberal hypocrisy they create fake narrative hindutva fascism when such things happen under bjp governments but can even bothered when routine elsewhere thus somehow everyday life becomes emergency when modi even nothing has actually changed since the days madam sonia and her secular friends ,-1

 meat costs more india government subsidy should focus providing healthy balanced and hygienically prepared meal the lowest possible price simple ignorance and unwillingness research which most the media always notorious for this actually issue thought was widely known that the bjp didn have role introducing this years wonder why modi didn simply repeal prohibition the problem here adding more states that list don know the story here opinion statement don know the story here opinion statement,1
whatabout whatabout whatabout whatabout whatabout were you born 2013 there was outrage when congress did stuff like this infact the popularity congress all time low precisely because they did bad stuff criticizing bjp endorsing congress congress has been fucking failure and people voted bjp with such massive majority because they thought bjp would different when bjp does the exact same thing the congress did people outrage and rightly ,-1
funnily enough sex education was banned congress ncp maharashtra too one could almost call them medieval right wing nuts,1

thanks for posting one the most descriptive pieces seen india however have issue with the fact that your headline and the content don match hindus may feeling prosecuted and marginalised but your article about the insidious harm casteism and baptism the opinion that the caste system would have been lot less prevalent today without the reservations economic reservation doing that our state essentials tells one more deserving simply birth this current sense victimhood combination factors the religious appeasement policies and the caste based appeasement policies ,1
you are right your observations but off the mark some group obc and forward caste members sensed that this would break the unity the hindu community and immediately diverted the issue ram temple which reminded them their common faith highly doubt that ram temple issue was created rift divide only conincidence that the just revived bjp from the ashes bjs needed issue survive they promptly picked ram temple issue because they wanted fight congress which was pro muslim kerala fortunes from hindu temples are nationalized for benefit all communities while those from churches mosques are tax exempt dear you are spot this one athiest but still feel one group society definetely victimised because this the marriage market where the truth about our divisions are magnified again spot the inclination assert one own social group the best can come from any human being earth excuses gdoms was the invasion tipu sultan which not now you are inside kerala history dont know thing there ,1

you realise that you will get very little resonance here randia particularly anti hindu one just has observe the daily circle jerk against hindus rss shakhas bhakts etc know this true the sheer amount abuse trotted out hindu gods and goddesses would counted hate speech any other forum but randia business usual and the mods look the other way when people abuse hindu gods let someone abuse islam christianity muslims christians then instant ban well written article though excellent insight and perfect ending imo ,1
 things identity politics your bane minority appeasement wrong minority protection and actually ensuring that everyone gets have fair chance correct unfortunately actually implementing even accepting what entails ones best interest many things which seem first glance stupid turn out correct laws and conversely many things which seem reasonable turn out have many unforseen and negative concequences when dealing with affirmative action laws read only headlines and you fail the nation ,1

nice post however don think unfair minority appeasement has led directly the rise hindu fundamentalism but rather general hindu antagonism which tends lend itself well hindu fundamentalists for example there was post about how atrocious some aspects the rte act were about year ago remember like you mention actually discourages majority communities from running educational institutions and that for testimony sorts the genuine problem minority appeasement india does exist and ignore narrow minded stuff like that can really make the majority feel inferior and disadvantaged and that obviously will lead disenchantment and even discord that think where hindu antagonism ends hindu fundamentalism begins think when that opposition deliberate disadvantage twisted into generalized opposition the recipients the unfair advantage separate community whether nor they are adamant retaining that unfair advantage hindu fundamentalism and hindu extremists are reactionary they have played that reactionary role for long time mobilizing mass opposition specific thing into mass opposition the recipients that thing even when its usually disconnected and vote hungry political class that created that thing and its subsequent strife the first place like you said sometimes you may not deserve advantage accorded you over poor brahmin boy and sure many many many people share that opinion across all minority religions the problem always starts and ends with gross generalizations matter which side you just two cents ,1
 but does the mistake painting all abrahamic minorities one brush don they all believe that there this one supreme god who will give you salvation you believe him and act his holy book and otherwise will damn you hell isn this the reason for conflict between abrahamic religions among themselves and with other religions and also the reason for conversions ,-1

looking the comments its looks like you are staunch hater modi dude there are more logical and reasonable ways criticise him whether his tears were real fake only can answer and not bound answer every stupid question now tell what gained after that far questions are concerned organization would want fuck such grand event stupid questions asked strangers only questions were asked which were handpicked the whole event was just formality honour his visit was not like presidential debate that happens usa chill out man now will downvoted like crazy ,-1
 highly likely that these two got ask the questions because they were internet org partners and thus got advantage but does this establish that modi knew the questions beforehand and mark question that led him crying was known him well fun make theories but think that they portray india someone who cries foreign land for cheap publicity going little too far ,1
this some weird circle jerk organised and planted questions that could used argument for internet org and most probably answers were already prepared like done every event every leader everywhere the world his crying was genuine gains publicity crying when media was already harping about his trip really stupid circle jerk took few days photoshop the pictures think ,-1

feel cheated already ,0
 not modi speech anymore modi concert sap center the question how long can this fake persona survive empty drumming ,-1
 totally agree that this was incident but the fact that mark was looking into the teleprompter because modi was speaking hindi language mark would not understand the teleprompter could just showing him the translation when first heard about internet org was very negative about totally kills net neutrality and boy the biggest supporter neutrality but this thought occurred that what the audience net neutrality the poor country side indians the biggest concern that buying internet pack not one time investment you have keep buying every month for someone who doesn know what internet and how can used this could used demo for free and anyone who wants leverage complete internet can always buy data pack any deal has both the parties benefitting see this the companies facebook reliance and other sites part this build good reputation and deep penetrate the market for the non technical country side indian they get see the premise internet don think bad earlier thought ,1
really you think that faked crying what the hell gain from watch that video its not like was crying out loud infact was trying hard contain his emotions and not the first time got emotional while talking abut his mom ,-1

 but very limited the focal length the phone camera phone cameras are almost all wide angle the iphone focal length about 29mm which less flattering than 85mm and above think would produce acceptable web quality photos but not print quality ,-1
because clever politician knows that commenting this trap open pandoras box both the left and the right will spin and interpret what ever says the tone and the content will heatedly discussed all over the nation not statesman like vajyapayee who can make statement and bear the brunt withsand the consequences ,1

this actually part familiar pattern swami adityanath sadhvi niranjan jyoti and giriraj singh have made outrageous remarks and modi stayed very silent modi simply cannot afford upset hindutva elements starts leaning leftwards they will find another bigot even you develop yoy 2019 bjp cannot win without polarisation religious lines and fragmented opposition the reason worried that these incidents have ripple effects theoughout the country yesterday there was rumor that somebody was killed muslims hyderabad thankfully turned out rumor things could lot worse god knows give rats ass about but letting hindutva forces run riot causes all kinds problems for everyone everywhere ,-1
this girl looks familiar feel like she from something edit someone explain why being downvoted ,1
 met guy who shot with very expensive gear nikon and leica the pictures looked craz sharp and has good colors but that was they had soul and were boring look yet all his friends were complimenting him telling took gold pictures was very awkward just nod felt was rich guy with too much time then met another amateur photograph shooting with simple nikon d750 knew was only amateur wasn raving the same friends compliments but was still getting lot praise imo was much better photograph yet had lesser gear use great video shows you don need carry 4kg dslr take good pictures ,1
playing devil advocate has commented elsewhere when the victim and oppressor demographics were reversed curious know this since would reveal any hypocrisy ,-1
this guy looks familiar dont think its him but looks exactly like someone from old reality show cant put finger real world road rules had guess maybe survivor ,1
 here iphone fashion shoot bikinis foamcore and flashlights 88260 the link the high res photos ,1

isn dadri incident finally confirmed villagers treating theift rather than about beef read here reddit ,1
 photographer consider using cellphone for tricky spots and situations only the phone can raw photos apple does this for iphone going one happy photographer ,1
they should played this vid the launch event best sales pitch ever,1
from you comments here quite clear that you are not asking question but want people bash modi for not condemning the incident wrong and you are indeed asking question here what think about this live third world shithole called india man lynched for allegedly eating beef another burnt alive for entering temple yet another raped the age years and then there couple publicly hung from tree for marrying per their wishes these ghastly incidents are almost everyday occurrences here expect the prime minister condemn each and every incident you want him condemn the dadri incident because the victim was muslim and the issue was the much publicised beef ban dailt might want him condemn the hamirpur incident women might want him condemn the pilibhit incident who all does please and what will all this achieve have federal government with layers governance going down the level panchayats there are district officials and party spokespersons communicate the official views the prime minister has the overall responsibility the country and honestly speaking naive expect him get involved all this condemnation business and frankly even was tweet about this people who have anti modi agenda and who have been waiting for doomsday arrive will not view him his government any differently isn ironical that people are blaming the rather than blaming the under whose direct control law and order the state vests redditors would make you believe that everyone uttar pradesh and all across india was happily consuming beef and celebrating eid and diwali together till modi came power imposed the ban aroused communal feelings and caused one innocent man lose his life someone who lived his formative years western uttar pradesh let tell you that the animosity between hindus and muslims spans decades and has nothing with the bjp the rss you want glimpse this please read the pucl report the meerut riots which resulted the infamous hashmipura and maliyana massacre modi did not tweet criticizing the muslims who gunned down jain boy meerut the muslims who thrashed two jat boys death for resisting molestation their sister muzzafarnagar reverse the communities and would outraging about these incidents well ,1
same reason why nobody from opposite spectrum comments kashmiri pandit issue now down vote just like you did when commented that scam too kashmiri muslims begging name kashmiri pandits without knowing such things happen did hurt your secualr feelings why were you down voting ,-1
this dadri case reminds peepli live yes the issue was different movie but media and politicians reaction has been along the same line have look kind news which emerging kejriwal first tweeted about authorities stopping him from meeting victim family then tweeted that has been allowed enter posted images with victim family ndtv reported their media crew car was stoned crew attacked dadri car window smashed 1225670 while the cops stood spectators rahul gandhi visits dadri after kejriwal and look the crowd surrounding him png bjp managed open its mouth but that obviously didn down well free the suspects isolated incident like they aren even trying few others went there well but cbf look them now now compare with peepli live village had never heard after spending almost years and around that region now trending twitter politicians always are milking the best their abilities visiting the family waves doing photo shoots with the family and showing sympathy with their fleet vehicles cops have been deployed huge numbers maintain law and order media camping out there for any shred story they can capture fabricate guessing there might even small town fair sorts with locals trying make quick buck out his sudden surge visitors like they did movie and here are wondering why hasn yet another politician showed his fake sympathies 140 characters less when the story dies natural death terms trp these camera carrying vultures will start disperse that family will pick pieces whatever left was gifted them from the politicians leave town which they should imo and wait for the eternal justice granted our blazing fast and competent judiciary ,1
 honest even atal bihari vajpayee had the courage openly condemn godhra incident against his own party and the rss goons and without any pre scripted media conferences this however himself one the rss people obvious how always becomes tongue tied whenever hindutva goons murder someone and commit crimes ,1
out habit,0
dadri lynching was not some unplanned random incident these are carefully planned bjp part their election agenda there communal tension all over jharkhand just before the bihar elections muzaffarnagar was planned fore the 2014 elections etc asking modi condemn these incidents would mean going against his party policy ,-1
maybe him its small incident statistics people dying from population billion isn worth even cough ,1
the camera isn important you can quite lot with d7100 and fast glass buy the camera you can afford and save the rest your money for better lenses right you don need but budding photographers would better off ditching their kit lenses keeping their bodies and investing fast glass ,1

 iphones have been taking amazing pictures since apple went with the bigger sensor the techniques used this photo shoot are basic knowledge photographers ,1
 mean understand that the iphone can take really great pictures especially for smartphone but better than d750 with the huge full frame sensor with interchangeable lens hell the ability change your aperture absolutely huge photography but the iphone can that understand the whole photographer not the camera spiel but you just simply cannot expect iphone produce similar qualities photos ,1
 yea right and hugh hefner neighbor ,1
what more surprising what the congress doing they are the called opposition they should attacking modi government right left and centre like the congress only playing covert game publicising all communal tension news that that itself would try and bring down the current govt without getting involved mud slinging what more startling than the strategic silence the govt the silence the principle opposition ,1
way get views but she hot,1
had until with little bit photoshop ,-1
 better tapping that mella ,1
still requires worth apple gear ,1
photography more the person behind the camera and the not the camera itself the camera simply tool ,1

 far too busy travelling lands far wide delivering speeches fawning nris fail understand why such great orator tongue tied when comes issues like this like manmohan silence was tactic for the rampant corruption namo just encouraging the rising intolerance,1
sources say modiji was very upset and that chided all the bjp guys who provoked the thing and also those bjp guys who came out support later ,1

 speaks indirectly through his minions listen what mahesh sharma said this was just accident people are trying give communal overtones his mla from the area said that hindus are being targeted some such only condemns deaths when they give him political mileage for example when that person died kejriwal rally this death means nothing him once called politics footpath politics also cms,0
this actually pretty informative video the girl the bikini doesn hurt though ,1
 101 doesn matter you are modi obama bill gates sachin tendulkar when you have large audience listening you then talking about safe subjects has more impact than talking about controversial subjects there always someone else available who will make the controversial points and take the brickbats ,1
 posted somewhere else too modi served pracharak propagandist purpose post was spread sangh ideologies throughout akhand bharat all know what sangh ideologies are you can estimate his devotion these ideologies with the fact that one point time decided become pracharak which requires one man leave his home not get married single why are you expecting that this man thoughts are any different from those religious nuts anything should thankful him that not opening his mouth these issues further worsen situation ,1
 this girl isn model wow,1
 was very telling form his first days office when disbanded the usual gaggle journalists who fly air india one with the and ask questions was further reiterated when stopped taking any questions all only pre scripted pre screened ones this has been going everywhere goes all his rallies and his rock star shows for the diaspora everything screen and pre screened carefully wonder what would happen the person the audience who doesn ask the pre screened question but instead asks real hard hitting question you know the ones like all heads state have answer their nations media and people only speaks things can control and ignores much reality the fact that was propogandist for rss for long speaks volumes that ideology ingrained him and very much leader all these hindutva rss extreme right wing people his minions the bjp echo his words but doesn need speak them otherwise will implicated very smart and very dangerous man not the kind india deserves took pride our diplomacy and our soft power pms who were the highest caliber least the international scene modi classless buffon embarrasing wherever goes ,1
because modi sincere politician and doesn want lie firstly honestly doesn give fuck about one dead muslim village has perused the facts the accident his union minister put and would know that mob killed the muslim hindu mob which was assembled the pundit temple meaning the killing had the popular support the village and you read the statements coming from the hindu right they haven outrightly condemned the incident either that why the local branch bjp has lent its support the killers and more importantly last time some muslims were killed mob narendra modi won the election for three consecutive times there absolutely political incentive for namo condemn the incident secondly there india beyond msm english press and reddit and that india many hindus support the action the mob and those hindus will cast their vote the upcoming elections amit shah knows that namo knows that ,1
because behind all the sophistication has crass shallow personality remember the crore girlfriend remark can you imagine nehru atal saying things like that rss pracharaks after decades indoctrination become the sort psycho which modi the difference modi highly functional one true for religious nuts among muslims christians too man just wait the day modi realizes may lose next elections will stoop his original riot mongering avatar maybe next godhra gujarat riot isn far away and would very sophisticated ,1
 was deeply saddened and also tweeted his condolence for the farmer who died during aap rally surprisingly dadri lynching doesn sadden him ,1

 eat beef not really support beef ban however believe the protection hindu religious sites not necessarily mandirs ayodha kashi and quite few others are sacred places for hindus most these are not well maintained and there needs concerted government effort improve them far the ram janmabhoomi movement not sure that the birthplace ram but from the asi findings remember congress was power then clear that there was temple there efforts have been made reach out the muslim community provide them larger land area bigger mosque alternate site believe the best course will for hindu religious sites declared exclusive areas just like mecca vatican and resolve this issue ,1

supporter economic policy and governance part bjp selectively sympathetic their hindutva cause but frequently find myself disagreeing with their agenda this front against beef ban any restrictions society because their interpretation hinduism let people decide for themselves they should stop preaching morality and clothes also uncomfortable with most them being just political hindus and being atheist agnostic and indifferent their personal lives that being hypocrites that also dangerous frequently meddling hindu religion without believing god will not make such people compassionate they will just look things from cultural angle whereas the culture itself has become regressive lot ways okay you don believe god hinduism but that case not speak for hindus and hindu religion not talking about those who just beleive hindu kulcha and soch you aren hindu the context talking about know advani wasn great believer and know many the current bjp guys aren anyways are digressing ram mandir front think should just follow whatever the supreme court rules sure there was temple there which was demolished and then mosque was built upon that sure there are hundreds such places india but have move and some time stop seeking justice for atrocities committed past the same time beleive bjp efforts educating people about history and rewriting parts which have been intentionally twisted for agendas when people say there was temple there why the fuck you want one more temple deny that such things happened past strongly disagree but when they say fuck and let move agree minorities status and issue the end game have mind pretty simple equality for all that simple but still very controversial christians want proselytising they want bastar and tribal gujarat and convert people there christianity alright fine with but then let hindus and rss the same calling ghar wapasi xyz just semantics the hindus are using money for that fine christians that too but not fine they are using threat violence for now some liberals use the argument that christians shall allowed convert but not hindus hinduism never believed that bullshit and sinister the other thing want end game respect for each other the name liberty let not start drawing prophet cartoons and start pissing idols you are atheist okay fine but fucking keep yourself don make fun preach you are muslim keep yourself and will friends also favor ucc favor some compromises from all sides some hindus and many jains are strongly vegetarians respect that and accommodate them not having butcher shops beef festivals very close them muslims believe only one god and explicitly say there isn any other god that alright that what their religion but not bloody come and tell that god fake don office railway station have seen some christians that and any public setting keep yourself muslims should not forced prove that they are indians but they should also not give impression that they put another concept over country stupid things like not saying vandemataram talking about caliphate opposing yoga supporting the enemy country should avoided there are lot things hindus also need but this post isn about that limiting myself topic hand ,1
the problem your question the wrong place beef ban and mandir issues are supported hindus age and above uneducated villagers who most probably dont use reddit hindus below and above only want modern and progressive also clean india most them think modi can make this happen they voted him for development not for religious bull they not expect muslim free india just want them progressive and less religious that opinion from what have seen among friends hope other users agree with answer ,1

you are simpleton and have been victim superficial propaganda you think bjp and its supporters including have such retarded things beef mandir etc our agenda its all media hype with only the whackos taking these petty issues seriously its the low hanging fruit for the lowest common denominator sane person the bjp camp even talks about these things hard bjp supporter including their religious agenda and let tell you brief how think greentext tiem india highly fragmented feudal and poor only ideologies make this diverse bunch behave like country slavery the name gandhi hindutva search your feelings and history and you know true ridiculous that foreign woman from different race religion country continent born and raised under different set cultural values for decades can come here under the banner gandhi and almost accepted our prime minister and was definitely accepted the head the most powerful political party india for over decade country diverse india predicted west balkanize somehow went through its bankruptcy and came out single nation state reason hindutva hinduism slavery name gandhi strong the abomination from the foreign whore literally cannot talk straight for than minutes literally makes sense all congress wants him the next prime minister their friends media intellectual circles and corporations end supporting him because they despise hindutva for real imagined reasons clearly congress has done and will more damage the country than hindutva can even imagine have good leaders hindutva modi and shah modi has actually proven himself gujarat done good work spread out over decade these can separate the rhetoric from reality advani was too much mandir movement modi uses hindutva gather support but does per wants good pragmatic politician now the rest how muslims must behave something according anyone who supports congress the enemy our nation state doesn matter how you give your allahus your akbars how you shove your jesus your christ how believing chubby kid with talking elephant head gives you meaning life you support congress then you are traitor book and you must eliminated any means necessary you support any other party then willing tolerate right now destruction neutralization the congress support infrastructure across political social and economic circles should our top priority now assuming the congress support infrastructure destroyed then and only then and not before rss becomes problem must eliminate them replaced better trained and equipped police force under independent judiciary but with covert powers hindu intellectuals become problem must eliminate them anyone who tries add religious talk education gets ass fucked hindu muslim christian cow piss magic bullshit earth 6000 years old and being pedo under special situations totally bro talk can and about this but won for the purposes this thread these points are enough and about ram mandir the rightfully hindu territory and will have back time the hate muslims have for american christian troops for polluting their sacred land mecca official motivation bin laden apparently the same hate hindus have against muslims for polluting our sacred land ayodhya only its worse our case because christians churches are not actually present inside mecca but muslims mosques are actually present the site ayodhya its also worse because christians came saudi arabia with the consent the government king whatever but muslims are staying ayodhya when have clearly stated that don want them there don give fuck where muslims choose live and build mosques india but atleast leave our sacred temples alone you motherfuckers don understand how this even for debate babri mosque culturally pretty insignificant muslims some mosque made name king but ayodhya and ram mandir are culturally extremely important for hindus the city 7th avatar vishnu who the preserver part the supreme being holy shit just give that small piece land and let worship our heroes and their flying monkey sidekicks why won muslims give possible that muslims think even the destruction single mosque for good infidel cause anywhere the world means that the holy war islam against infidels just took step back and that cannot allowed happen just imagine how much peace would there muslims let build our temple like holy shit can achieve many different goals simultaneously creates good impression hindu community discourages communal politics throughout india makes leaders like advani irrelevant rss and bjp loses good part its support you can emotionally blackmail hindus the future for reservations something this genius political and cultural move and yet muslims won this makes seriously question the loyalties muslims community seriously think they will demand another pakistan their numbers are high enough well just hope muslims begin rape and pillage europe soon that might see how the west reacts godhra style riot happens the west then they lose the moral right tell brownskins how deal with muslims and that gives our hindu right government that much free hand whatever the fuck wants ,1

the numbers may not lying actually india slightly more peaceful but not owe our leaders what actually brought upon the change narendra modi biggest grouse was that felt that media was unusually harsh him for 2002 murderous hindu mobs guided congress politicians roamed the streets delhi slaughtering sikhs and most the main accused never faced justice same goes for bombay riots shiv sena goons rioted with impunity and the chief accused managed scot free same goes for bhagalpur and many other instances communal riots what actually changed from 2002 the ubiquitous television camera ground reporting media yes the same msm which few never tire complaining about forces nay shames administration into taking steps quell disturbances the state has always possessed the capability control these communal disturbances but due its own biases and the bigotry those administration the mobs were allowed violent but the omni present media makes tougher now yogi adityanath demonstrates riots are still looked upon some quench their lust for power but now when yogi makes inflammatory comment recorded the act and though seems insignificant small way made accountable for his words and deeds would have gotten away with lot worse earlier should also explain why some people continue complaining about media say what you will but the glare televisions cameras make the engineering genocide bit tougher however any riot shameful because these riots operate with the complicity those power and each act communal disturbance indictment the political leaders ,1
whenever see statistics trying prove disprove something immediately grow suspicious numbers can played around represent whatever you intend show impossible conclusively infer from them now coming the numbers and chart that article please take look the source mentioned there htm tried playing around with the numbers just the author has done and realised number flaws first visually the chart wrong take look kerala has coefficient 2014 but the orange line does not dip below that region all the author forcefully trying prove trend secondly the methodology incidence communal violence given state given year from which subtracted its share the total population the country wrong you have states uts which have had incidences having different negative coefficients relative their population thirdly any statisticians out there back how does the number incidents correlate the population the state which means delhi meghalaya which have similar population will have the same baseline subtraction theoretically are taking for granted that the rate incidences similar populated states should same why this comes next point that indeed the data has shown like this then another variable the percentage muslim population the state also has taken into account guessing the author only intended focus hindu muslim conflicts and not hindu christian hindu buddhists now this will also show interesting fact the states uts with highest muslim population percentages lakshwadeep assam kerala actually fare quite well this study anyways after about one hour playing with the data was confused what objective was when started off because these data not really show any significant trend anything think the author mentions this the article well you can manipulate this data whatever extent you want and can show exact opposite trends what would question why are looking bad now worse than before have muslims been faring better the past and half year their more confidence between the communities now has inter communal relations become more hostile over this period these questions cannot answered these statistics ,-1

this article doesn make much sense think its fair question the influence that power the center has the rest the country but think most people are generally concerned about how the general rise power hindutva outfits and the sangh parivar affects hindu extremism this framework its not about which governments are power its more about how general rise power affecting local dynamics congress run state for example can see rise communal violence local hindu extremists are becoming increasingly bold and violent but does make any sense blame this congress unless you trying actually disaggregate the data and explain different trends communal violence different states this kind use statistics just useless hence the saying there are lies damn lies and statistics also the author article plainly does not have good understanding math the first place for example there have been some dubious attempts make such assertion looking truncated and incomplete data thus was asserted that communal violence increased nearly the first five months 2015 under the modi government against the first five months 2014 during the last days the upa the actual raw numbers are 287 incidents january may 2015 against 232 incidents the corresponding period 2014 leaving aside the fact there‚Äô relatively small absolute difference between the two numbers and there‚Äô way know the difference statistically significant the larger point that comparing any two arbitrary time periods one can get just about any result you want the conclusion here correct but 287 incidents compared 232 incidents not relatively small absolute difference that increase you can just proclaim this statistically insignificant because its inconvenient please folks actually look the article and engage with the numbers instead just accepting the title fact ,1

generally speaking the main quest affected side quests and job quests with people acknowledging who you are job quests can potentially have you affected acknowledging you are adept different job job quests and side quests generally don recognize you for the main though these are usually time bubble the main quest events don affect these quests meeting estinien the main quest won have him act like you have met him when you the dragoon quests ,1
 loved that the npc from last year all saints wake recognized the cutscene this year ,1
this also happens with quest text the character was imported from some main scenario npcs the story will say they feel like they know you from somewhere and after the final fight everyone starts remember you cid even mentions how you saved the world twice like the adaptive quest texts makes feel like more involved with the npcs lives ,1
 congress plus cow has way with his words ,-1
another reference remember one hildibrand quest you did the quest where you end giving godberg massage acknowledges calling you the first time appears the one with the strong yet tender hands something like that ,1
yes there few places where lines are little different you unlocked certain jobs off the top head know that there some different lines you unlocked completed dragoon and there another spot where dialog changes you unlocked smn for cul and drg pre quests they are considered time bubble happened the past ,1
yes certain dialog changes least based job quest the culinarian one specifically doesn change because they locked the point time which the quest was created and since the quest existed before things went down dah isn affected there the part when tataru tries become arcanist and the dialog changes slightly you leveled acn ditto for some yugiri dialog you leveled nin and some heavensward dialog you leveled drg can think any non job quests that affect dialog offhand but some might exist ,-1
 yes several quests will acknowledge that you leveled certain class job you leveled drg estinien acknowledges you fellow azure dragoon the story quests you leveled arcanist the guild leader acknowledges that when tataru goes around trying figure out what she wants class job quests are sort locked time when they were made there are anachronisms due story level cul quests took place long before those events that you mentioned transpired ,1

our gdp numbers are joke ruchir sharma made great point that the financial world become similar nigeria massaging our gdp figures there way are growing and the numbers keep getting revised downwards the imf has already revised our gdp downwards three times there massive mean reversion the base effect wears off there huge difference between dipp fdi numbers and rbi fdi numbers similarly recent article came out showing how fdi has nothing with make india pmo being criticised for being overly centralised which stopping work the govt instead doing real work seems hell bent managing expectations you can micromanage economy the key free market reforms providing free market space and letting the market allocate capital see fit that why people invest places like china micromanaging few multinationals through the investment phase then claiming india open for business will never have the desired effect and most importantly economies are led sme you make easier for one big multinational will make difference but small policy changes which affect thousands sme will really send the economy through the roof you look the ipo market for the last years its been very weak seen very few sme able make that jump this does not bode well going forward you can solely rely large corporations drive the investment cycle have problems everywhere you look except maybe car sales and big billion sales around diwali but seriously agri manufacturing and rate cuts won anything there already overcapacity every industry manufacturing housing edit was going mention the congress plus cow comment but lol see you beat lolol,1

 really amazing how much traction this rising intolerance stuff getting considering how shallow really and the fact that not one the guys behind these protests can give satisfactory explanation for why intolerance has apparently risen overnight and modi blame for all textbook goebbels just repeat the same thing again and again without thinking and becomes accepted fact ,1

the fact that beef banned shows rising intolerance certain communities who not eat beef then feel the government has validated them enforce themselves onto other communities strongly against the beef ban not because favourite meat but because the divisive and intolerant behaviour approves and the divisive message sends ,1
this comment had posted earlier cents will try explain why think lost people seem quick criticize modi for communal problems india was born and brought mangalore communal tension common there every year used have school shutdown for few days and bajrang dal was and very strong there some small things like muslim boy marrying hindu girl hindu boy marrying muslim girl would tick people off from both sides and shit would escalate out control was from hindu brahmin family and even was afraid bajrang dal when modi came power there was massive rally these nutcase hindu groups many school friends participated this rally unfortunately and people this rally were openly saying things like now you wait and see what happens muslim neighborhoods they all think their time has come they all feel they won touched and that they have the pms support that why they have become extra bold modi responds strongly one incident against right wing just once come out openly and say something throw some these people jail these people will know not with their shit but unfortunately central government hasn done that both sides treat them both equally and throw people from both sides jail that even better but modi needs take strong stance against religious intolerance from both sides not the rise intolerance that the problem the fact that most these extreme right wing crazies think they have centers support and take center silence yes have seen and talked many bajrang dal mangalore and they truly believe and the other communities think they are under attack and also think the center supports the right wing sure center doesn support either side but silence not helping one clear and loud message from modi condemning both sides and rss etc for this will get everyone confidence back that edit lots comments cannot individually reply but some clarification not saying modi responsible not saying has apologize for every incident that crazy and unfair cant hold one person accountable for billion people that humanely not possible but because lot right wing crazies think modi supports them modi comes out and clarifies once and for all people will calm down right wing will know they dont have the support support dont mean legal support states duty many said and the minorities will stop crying that supports them someone below mentioned about discrimination against black community the example when black people went rampage obama did make statement that was not for black people riot like the way they were many people thought obama was support blacklivesmatter because black too but came out and said understands their frustration but was dead against their method showing that frustration actually came out and acknowledged the shitty behavior minority was doing even though black community hardcore supporters his own democratic party just modi coming out and openly criticizing these right wing actions will calm things down certain extent ,1
okay how about this respect your view that things were always like this and you the same for anybody who thinks intolerance the rise have statistics give because don need them myself everything doesn need quantification maybe can feel see news about new sena everyday threatening violence commiting violent act may not the smartest guy but know how india works and expect anybody who has even tidy bit knowledge how india works would know the same someone really believes that these fringe elements aren motivated the fact that people power are the same ideology them and have become more confident well that them that isn enough look some the and mla speeches from the ruling party some even hold highest offices think intolerance the rise have fundamental right have that view same you how about you don question mine and don question yours ,1

 fyi had riots after akhileshji came into govt there within the first years governance are busy dealing with shiv sena entire country peaceful otherwise except for these coward mumbaikars their coward party this news about riots other parts country pure horseshit ,1
your quest for finding statistics prove disprove intolerance futile the perception rise intolerance has become prevalent when people hear the incidents just confirming their opinion the kamandal party being itself with the 2002 modi the helm would agree this unfair assessment modi bjp have not done anything except for few pig headed statements from ministers deserve this spell award wapsi the party doing piss poor job getting the message back development and has been concentrating dog whistling the beef thing claim this some grand leftist media conspiracy malign the good work this government just naive ,-1

 whether agree with them not and even like not damage being done everyone knew the leftist academia not going let without fight ever since bjp got elected even before the elections saw these editorials these very same publications and its not like they are going change their opinions fact that publications like nyt economist guardian huffpost are leftist inclined their respective countries and its only fair they side with the leftists india create narrative that hitler rising from his graves india like faux news propaganda cycle crying from the rooftops that hussein obumber come grab their guns and money give blacks sample the quote from nyt the fact india riven hatred and held hostage bullshit india today far more accommodating and tolerant than india has even been post independence just like more racially accomodating than the jim crow days even with police shootings blacks now how many actual acts intolerance have happened the past one year aside from sound bites two three country billion get fucking perspective nyt and their desi supporters statistical aberration noise and one final thing money begets money the investors dont give shit beef banned some hindu kills muslim remote corner country vice versa long the govt promoted pro business measures which they are money will keep coming ,1
what can say congress left propaganda bearing fruit the nyt editorial you have linked references moody analytics that was hyped indian media but actually not moody ,-1
wow that nyt piece was the new york times editorial board the editorial board composed journalists with wide ranging areas expertise their primary responsibility write the times‚Äô editorials which represent the voice the board its editor and the publisher for piece that purports have the weight the nyt editorial board behind this quite scant detail opinion just lump few things together and hit print ,-1
most indians especially smaller places are inherently racist casteist caste politics ugly reality game both sides play make mistake but sections the msm get particularly agitated when the right wing who are the accused remember the ram leela agitation anna hazare ndtv practically looked the other way they only covered what they did because the event reached shrill pitch can you imagine what role this channel would play there was similar nation wide agitation against the bjp blatant bias against one side the media full thugs senior journalist playing courier pigeons inside the political network act like that just another day work india caste problems have always been ugly the trying build image can get the big leagues but certain class people are holding their personal agenda above the country good all countries have their internal problems usa has their cops minorities issues countries have ton hardliners gaining power because the refugee crisis china has their human rights problem imo unpatriotic wash your dirty linen public thriving india has much better scope for solving its internal problems than poor india where people are each others necks for scarce resources ,-1
 damage being done and this what the political opposition congress and left want they rather destroy india than let ruled some one else not from their persuasion from the day modi got elected congress too has been trying something other stoke disturbances recently they appeared getting hold gujarat through hardick but thankfully that fizzled out then had the assam congress men throwing beef into temple stoke communal passions inb4 someone accuses defending the lynching was crime and needs judged and the guilty punished period ifs and buts point grow some fucking perspective how this country has always had the hindu muslim issue given its history how things were much worse the past and how have progressed point that even its the peace the graveyard its still shaky peace also grow some perspective that this country billion and one two acts happening lawless regions statistical aberration and not the growing intolerance the billion the pundits crying murder studios and media editorials know that but for them its war bjp and reputation india mere collateral damage they can achieve the stabilisation the elected government just don bother denying when have had actual instances opposition mps and leftist academia writing letters stop modi they can that anything can done ,-1
did india say anything when there blatant killings black and racism what about riots over the years hmmm,-1
this what don get how that amit shah and other bjp leaders fringe not you decide saying these things are not damaging and when media reports damaging even selective reporting how media reporting about lynching greater wrong than the actual lynching itself ,-1
does not matter these are all perceptions retards like bakra dutt and assdeep sardesai believe that india practically syria now and rss basically just cancerous version beyond point you cannot fight hyperbole since always based some real facts and oodles creativity there are just couple ways neutralize create enough good solid counter news progress women equality renewable energy etc work killing the base level factual realities perception dirty can fought with strict penalties peeing the streets throwing rubbish the roads etc modi just needs bulk and keep playing his game the game town not the dogs who bark him and small jpg ,-1
 for this reason not opening his mouth adityanath sadhvi prachi mahesh sharma aside the somewhat saner bjp people like shah terms political correctness are having their statements misquoted and taken out context now imagine that happens the prime minister india when speaks within moments india whole will called communal state like isis all initiatives like swach bharat make india gone down the drain modi speaks misquoted doesn willing tolerate and encourage hindu hardliners and remember westerners almost always reads their news from the internet from news sites facebook thing worry about ,1
you should angry amit shah yogi adityanath etc for being such communal pieces shit and modi not saying word the issue rather the western media who report this ,-1

such intolerance not new back the 90s when was high school were visiting small town tamil nadu and out shopping with some friends and made funny comment reference jayalalitha shop and was immediately told hush our hosts and once reached home was told that you shouldn say negative things about any politician public because their supporters are mostly goons who would cause problems having grown big city and school where regularly talked about current affairs and the first few minutes the school day were spent discussing the days top news stories was complete shock that you could get into trouble for merely speaking out and then ended moving tamil nadu for college and learnt that you should careful about criticising any tamil movies either you risked running into some violent fans the actors was happy move out there and have not have been the kind social circles where don have worry about speaking mind over the last few years social media has changed all that first started with iac and aap questioning anything about anna hazare and his lokpal was primarily met with name calling once aap came around got worse and then the 2014 campaign started and things just went rapidly downhill during the same period year period our cities have grown rapidly due immigration from smaller towns and villages and internet access which was mostly limited the urban elite became affordable the common man and this kind polarised say anything against favorite leader actor etc and round gang thugs and rough you scenario what most those people grew and for them this par for the course for political discourse and even though they have just found new medium express their views the way they remains the same the moderates will always just fly under the radar and avoid engaging with such elements look the bihar verdict bjp propaganda and their fanbois propagating would have you believe that modi and his plan the only way forward and anyone even questioning anti national and even the exit polls seemed endorse the view that this view was resonating with the population because only people already vocal about their views would readily submit any exit poll but the final results clearly showed that they were all wrong and the majority don care about this brand politics propaganda also there eleanor rooselvent quote great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people when have such large chunk the population that barely literate and education system that penalises independent thought you cannot expect have any kind normal debate policies plans with the average indian who raised never question authority status quo but they are definitely smart enough discuss events and how impacts them and react accordingly ,1

this political tribalism not unique the bjp what you think was happening when the aap was making waves before the general elections later the delhi elections every time you expressed scepticism about aap kejriwal your credentials were questioned back look some the earlier threads this sub reddit especially the ones related the delhi elections you will get the exact same feeling the reason why the congress did and does not not have frenzied following because unlike modi aap not recent phenomenon not party that the younger generation immediately relates they dont have charismatic mass leaders who appeal the year olds can out limb and say that most the blind followers both aap bjp this subreddit social media forums elsewhere voted for the first time the last couple years and are largely the age group pretty sure you are one them yourself you talk the slightly older supporters and you will get more objective view ,1

because you all have your pitchforks ready every moment hard for someone make you people understand you all are bit too much hater generalization because this all who you are everything that politician does say wrong very rarely see you people praise anything remember you all praised politician coz supported doping now you are ready understand this country democracy meaning the politicians are responsible its citizens the bureaucracy judges officers are not answerable people you can not question bureaucrat public because according constitution not responsible you but ministers public servants elected the elected leaders responsibility question and keep checks and balances officials public will question him her not the officials stop hating your politicians this will lead you all nowhere and shows you all not interested democracy but bureaucracy autocratic judiciary not loose faith your politicians because only they are answerable you not any one else what the lady ips officer did was absolute rubbish and what doing condemning the minister blunder she terms should have replied minister like that this not school she should have maintained decorum and her behaviour unfit officer what she did was absolute non sense just because she officer that does not mean that she right and just because vij politician should not ridiculed abused the one who will asked questions and his years report card can and will questioned people not the officers lay down your pitchforks and try understand things before coming judgement ,1

 take this from completely different angle management the politician the senior manager the junior manager the ngp people are the consumers the consumers are complaining cause they received deficient service the junior manager defends her position saying that the customer has not followed the correct procedure the matter has been escalated the senior manager the senior manager asks the junior manager why there has been deficiency service the junior manager again defends her position additionally citing that her hands are tied she does not have powers anything more the senior manager puts the blame squarely the junior manager saying that there lack initiative from the junior manager towards making sure that there good service delivery the junior manager takes one step further saying that the company was fault was the one which promised service delivery this the senior manager enraged and storms out the meeting saying that going recommend the ceo take action against the junior manager now that have take the political parties civil service govt etc etc out the story you can see that what happens every private institution across india including private and mnc would say that this attitude and even cultural social problem india where try and shift the blame others rather than take responsibility for get things done fixed ,1

while quite sure the bjp whole would have voted against homosexuality today over 440 out 545 mps bunked the lok sabha avoid this bill and the remaining 100 only voted for tharoor amendment this disgusting beyond words and applies our entire political class secular communal inclusive nationalist whatever they call themselves ,-1

lots people questioning the data million official version suggests 2012 asia india 17363200 might good idea update your post otherwise people will just focus this and not the bigger point that you raised ,1
 thats not the issue here guys and yes the number that high and even higher when you factor the number straight people with homosexual leanings and bisexuals you need more shows with gays that indian folks are ignorant the populace adults estimate that americans are gay lesbian estimate americans gay lesbian aspx and they had enough theyre not going role over and die this not the end its just the beginning lool,1

fuck our mps general man where was the 200 odd opposition general when they were needed the most only voted favour congress and tmc combined could have gotten this bill introduced fucking disgusting ,-1
that idiotic section 377 not what india needs focus today that cheap move sahshi tharoor tabling this bill without taking account the various sects groups india without any serious debate nationally just show bjp poor light all this aside india needs focus economic growth for the next years and not people rights paper congress kept doing the same thing right after right just kept people relatively poor ,-1
fuck the rss should your mantra bjp small offering that terror group the baghdadi that group bhagwat will ensure that homosexuals will wiped out from this country just like hitler exterminated worse than kill them out was swastika era then germany now india watch out and save yourself you would sent for experimentation nagpur some moderators randia acts behalf rss make sure you don share personal info ,-1
 you haven noticed lot important matters national interest are being held the opposition these matters have taken years hard work and will benefit millions people with what logic did you expect that bjp will support tharoor overnight whims just like that ,1
 every persons gay where did you get this from ,1
 addition what you read recommend river fire river water and shin buddhism bits rubble turn into gold both taitetsu unno also the reason why shin buddhist churches are even the because early japanese immigration and later sustained japanese american communities while they were placed internment concentration camps our government during ww2 they are called churches the first place that they could allowed established nation which had prejudice against non christian forms religion the churches continue source support for new japanese immigrants today the emphasis japanese american identity understandable found when going temples like this once they see not just tourist through frequent attendance and participating other activities they hold people get used ,1
amid all the stalling the upper house and the hoopla surrounding the gst bill this was perfect opportunity for bjp capitalize and show congress which the better party but they have pander their regressive religious vote banks and this pretty much what congress wanted when tharoor had tabled his bill ,1
 know many gay people date have yet meet single one who supports bjp among muslim friends the ratio bjp supporters something like out atheists pretty much hate bjp don know many christians but imagine that skewered towards bjp here the thing bjp has very well defined political strategy hardcore hindus will always vote for bjp even modi turns out actually hitler reincarnate they still vote bjp moderate hindus are with the dibilopment targeted them move the needle bjp hope that the hardcore moderate hindus voteshare large enough result victories for them this just execution their political strategy keep the hardcore hindus happy while few moderate hindus will care have had people the moderate hindu camp basically say dibilopment first equality later even facebook wall full comment replies gay friends posts trying justify this ,1
hey don depressed fight for this together you said this just the beginning long road forward ,-1
 sent shashi tharoor tweet and rant whatsapp circles who have social conservatives and big namo supporters and all hear return were crickets chirping hypocrisy much ,1
this pathetic even though their stand party was quite clear from the beginning hope better sense prevails and next one two years the illegality around homosexuality resolved but the meantime there needs societal change the political change will not happen before the social change seems and may wrong there large scale movement around this may that because the status 377 any case the voices for lgbt support need amplified thousand times for reach the deaf ears our politicians ,-1

 fellow gay person surprised you stayed bjp supporter after december 2013 but then know some gay men who are actually blaming inc for today defeat dont really have high hopes for lgbt rights this country confession time till dec 2013 hated congress wholeheartedly and thought bjp will better even thought voting for them that was the time saw bjp for what they were majoritarianism was their bread and butter saw that only when affected the selfish directly they were actually worse than congress the inc 2013 least let the minorities exist secondary citizens bjp would never let anyone other than hindus survive this country ,-1
when you say fuck bjp what kind sex you have your mind ,1
wait minute you are expecting bjp pass bill which was introduced opposition party man obviously defeated regardless its contents its more with politics than gay rights ,1
only gay lesbian upvoted this comment ,1
 stopped reading after the rant warning but the bjp proved that they are not discriminate they are intolerant about anything and everything another note when this was being discussed one the news channels shania representing the bjp clearly thought that this was non issue and that the government had much better things pursue you could see that she was not even comfortable with the topic ,1
 this will happen everyday this government slowly losing favor everywhere look bihar gujarat elections the policy looting the people corrupt bjp goons getting exposed now slowly evident matter who you choose when they come power they become corrupt because absolute power corrupts were chanting modi modi 2014 but its just year and have lost all faith this guy ,-1

this why have game set use the japanese audio and just read the subtitles instead ,-1
their voices and acting aren bad who cares they haven had experience before this you have start somewhere something you also failed realize that the actors are actually english this time instead faking english accents ,-1
 know that voice from somewhere shrugs and keeps playing only know the voice actors that seem every single game arr and does not matter how long the voice actor resume are they all sounded mediocre horrendously bad ,-1
all can say maybe those actors that were let were working other projects the time they were needed for and they weren available they had with alternative means that happens lot the business ,1
 concern that the casting change reflects mindset square that western audiences are not interested story and therefore worthwhile redistribution resources would move money away from english voice acting could this could that there are simply not nearly many english vas there are japanese and those who are vas are simply not well known because the role not remotely near prestigious english speaking countries japan this being one the very few times discussion about english voice acting has popped any discussion board anywhere and the relative lack passion getting outside the main post has doubt contributed very valid conclusion that the english audience does not concern itself with english voice acting anywhere near their counterparts japan mindset square that western audiences are not interested story not sure how you leaped this conclusion generally don tie the quality story the voice acting sometimes even live acting unless very bad and this game nowhere near that yet more with plot and visual effects and suspect nowhere near alone this least with western audiences ,-1
 impressed with the amount effort you put into researching all that that being said english voice acting terrible investment while japanese voice acting good one this can seen all asian media including anime and movies the issue due the massive differences language because how drastically the feel the dialog changes translation you could get list actor and still have sound like complete shit good example this can found with english voice casts miyazaki films they are filled with very expensive list actors and the dubbing still kind sounds like shit compared the original ,1
 they simply decided that was not worth continuing with the previous cast proof there are many reasons that could possible that caused them with the new cast old cast busy not much more money spend voice actors actors wanting more money than willing paid etc clearly square treats its western and eastern audiences differently voice actors are treated much differently japan and america frankly surprise anime least the voice actors tend make several times more than any the animators and often more than the higher ups too ,1
 got the feeling that they just went one acting company for which would simpler and significantly cheaper than keeping lots ongoing contracts and possibly better result have evidence for this arr voice track was not memorable and neither don view big deal miss one two especially merlwyb voice actors anime are big deal japan their english knock offs are not there comparison unless trying compete with shrek pixar movie that not going happen ,1
somethign note here that sometimes experience doesn always equal quality you could end with things like miscast misdirect etc and the industry never cultivated newer talent then there point having voice acting industry begin with mean nobody fucking expected cristina vee well that she now iconic and recognizable laura bailey ffs also only narrowing down their experience video games terrible terrible way judging how good they are acting for example raw talent may not always have portfolio but someone notices their voice and gets them gig that one gig the seed that starts their careers and before they know they household name also consider other sources and don just mean the big screen either why don you consider things like theatre plays broadway musicals and the like not everyone has experiences that are recorded dvd some these you have see live even know they exist there reason patrick stewart performances are said have shakespearean vibe them that where majority his experience draws from real unfortunate that ends getting typecasted more often than not waste his potential given what seen out him don narrow your interpretation what can that will only bias your opinion into thinking they not capable enough take this role and besides even they weren experienced they never get chance show what they can you never know how good they could been ,-1
ultimately feel comes down the voice acting scene and how differs between america and japan voice actors japan are idolized and fangasmed over our hollywood actors are and animation and video games are taken quite bit more seriously the eastern market compared the western for the video games part you really only have look south korea and the start the modern sports scene unless voice actor also well known live action star most western individuals would not able name that many voice actors until fairly recently animation the west has been looked down upon lesser art form possibly not even art form all depending who you ask and once again has only been comparatively recently that started seen more valid medium which express visual medium such our voice actor pool quite small now compare the eastern market animation well loved with long storied history that was taken seriously its market more less since the 60s not earlier with the advent televised animation series the voice actor pool for the eastern market huge and often entire career can made single animated series entire career nothing but animation voice work just have less those types actors around and they often have take whatever work comes their way continue their career leading gaps like this more than likely the previous actors were simply unavailable they were looking break out into more serious work the time could the mindset that animation and video game work still isn taken seriously the west though believe that slowly changing with pixar dreamworks could you say that square thinks don care about story ultimately think the problem lies with and our dismissal animation until fairly recently and the mindset western audiences regards cartoons there even problem all that has lead this gap ,1
 the only one who hates midgardsormr new personally felt had more powerful arr ,1

 english and some the arr voice acting was just beyond painful listen with couple exceptions the much better ,-1
put this way when have such negative stigma for english dubs japanese works not surprising that square enix doesn feel like worth investing much money into hiring voice actors voice lines that may never heard ,-1
honestly feels like they trying get new blood use regulars actually inclined worry less since has much higher quality voice direction than arr did with even portion the talent being well known ,1
 think would rather have consistency than talent and can explain why consistency makes for good experience moving forward suddenly changing voice acting casts ruins some the immersion voice actor dialogue isn working its the sound designer work with the voice actor fix the problem its the same problem with movies where actors get the blame for bad acting when the director the one calling the shots and giving the take the thumbs ,1
 feel that bit stretch draw that conclusion think the decision recast the english voice actors was more directorial decision rather than financial one the sudden shift can better seen the direction how square wanted english eorzea actually sound rather than just bunch american voices and accents accents thats the real hint all this heavensward you can really see how people from different places eorzea have different accents with their speech help stress the cultural differences notice how rauhban and ilbred both talk and pronounce way different from the rest the dah cast better yet notice how like half the cast just the voices from xenoblade they wanted more english cast american one ,1
snake gaius van baelsar want hayter mmo now ,0
honestly having not heard the japanese voice work the game can weight one way another what astounds the sheer number people who think japanese sounds better default most the time japanese voice acting too fluid sound natural often missing delaying noises that most japanese use even when they don need delay their statement combine that with the lack social niceties most japanese dialogue animation and games and just feels bad take for example the animation rune soldier louie the english voice acting that far superior the japanese voice acting though most otaku term really hate use would argue the opposite from ignorance ,1
 remember reading they decided outsource their different studio for heavensward very likely that the one that recorded for xenoblade seemingly the last minute they probably did because was convenient for them terms costs and management honest with the exception few very good vas gideon emery will forever missed didn lose out much heavensward has been very solid compared arr with most the vas from xenoblade which had very high qulity dub itself joining the team ,1
 prefer lot the new voices the old voices tbh just because voice actor isn famous doesn mean they not good and gives newer chance get their feet the door difficult industry edit also the majority the casting changes are because timed contracts wearing out ,-1
 disliked the voice acting arr much changed any other language but english don think much that they invest heavily japanese seiyuu but that the industry much more established japan seiyuu are also big draw for japanese players and some non japanese guessing whereas only know taliesin jaffe name and that from critical role ,1
 thought shtola sounded familiar ,1
 feel like that utterly bizarre conclusion draw the voice acting heavensward not bad any stretch the imagination and fact think lot people would argue better are the voice actors well known maybe not but anything more inclined give pat the back for giving new blood opportunity start getting some notches their belt big title rather than keep replying actors who are already established not mention honestly hearing the same every game can get tiresome itself ,1
well the thing that moved from mostly american based cast arr many whom were only vas anime video games british based cast comprised actors who are mostly and film actors tracy ann oberman merlwyb for example actress the and was several episodes doctor who among other shows gemma whelan igeyorhm plays yara greyjoy game thrones matt stokoe elidibus from the musketeers and misfits colin ryan alphinaud played major characters two series the leonardo and hounded anything the voice cast technically more famous the sense that they actors who are and film actors rather than just vas they just mostly happen british rather than american and therefore most people don recognize their names this actually more line with japan voice actors ,1
voice acting huge field general they don have out their way for decent vas not much the west they want talent compared they would have hire aaa celebrities just like disney and pixar when they have their animated films ,1

one the best tricks got for coming with npc names the fly looking around the room spotting something and making play its name for instance have laptop stand using right now and has the brand name griffin from which can pull the names grif fin firg riffi nirg etc also have monitor front giving the names monty tor oni nom itor etc ,1
another good source for names found the galactic campaign guide from wotc obviously for the d20 system but has whole section with names and name generating guidelines for whole bunch species ,1
 never without names sheet part any session prep create list about theme appropriate names and keep next ever comes can glance down and instantly have players seem love because they once said love how every character has name you can make names the fly envy you can make entire plot arcs and weave storylines the fly but names are hard for lol,1
valo dissitad kal terax sado chance kyp galia rhel vendar tex 417 these are the names current pcs year campaign run you want archetype character traits could share those too feel free use the names npc names find names actually make great sources npc names simply because much thought goes into selecting them usually ,1
 also bad sci names the fly all make names week and keep them pice paper text doc that way you eventually have like names waiting for you any given time and you just resupply your list between sessions ,1

 hope this doesn give the anti reservation brigade fodder fuel their little adolescent gripe about how didn get that uni seat despite scoring higher than someone else the recent caste census which the government hesitant about publishing shows that very very roughly the caste demographics are obcs upper castes now even anecdotally most would agree that the names the last category dominate the ranks institutions education employment good schools corporations colleges government offices such skewed picture where power held few the top reservation still needed but with strict clause against the economically strong reserved categories what happening here has more with structural economic issue lack industrialisation and factory jobs that could then handed people like the jats who are being rendered jobless rapidly shrinking agrarian economy most them are landed and some powerfully connected but these agitators are lumpens who wouldn fighting for reservations for pen pushers government offices they instead had private sector factory jobs systemic lack jobs becomes issue reservation for well off community like jats economy where the government the main source employment tldr not malign reservation system for this real root problem agrarian decline and lack industrialisation ,1

 didn vote for bjp either but was all ready vote for them 2019 because realized any government will need ten years show changes unlike feel statements like this country fucked over reaction yes have had quite few headline grabbing events the past one month but none them barring the haryana incident perhaps affected anything more than the population there whole wide world outside what the media covers and things are improving there but agree where coming from and truly pissed the way the government has been derailing its own mandate reforms our country are such low hanging fruit that the government could have done nothing but the bare minimum technology deployments and they would have been back power 2019 now not really sure have never ever felt such viciousness from any party its supporters was not alive during indira gandhi tenure would any day take scam over almost the entire population feeling victimized brain washed one way the other ready for third front 2019 true reforms will much slower but india has grown earlier when the government was auto pilot can continue run that way instead risking civil war something ,1

yea although the homeopathic treatments were effective and perhaps homeopathy not really viable option that still does not discount effectiveness ayurveda yoga and other treatments and categorize all them the same bracket and discount them all not fair ayurveda fact now being sold heavily across the world very well reputed brands selling various cosmetic and general health treatments all the negative stuff you are mentioning that tells you seem follow lot msm india blindly while there truth some them others are over exaggerated most cases for the policy decisions and following upa footsteps would say the biggest difference implementation and honest there were decisions that were taken before fdi retail aadhaar etc you think will easier scrap everything that upa did the last years first that would mean scrapping all the investments that have been made those projects far which lot money second would still have through both the lok sabha and rajya sabha and without the numbers its really difficult get anything cleared instead you live with the shit you got and try improve which honestly believe the govt doing and agree with all heart that they should tame down their rss vhp bajrang dal etc dogs and motor mouths but apart from that don have any issues with bjp and yes will vote them power again purely because they are doing stuff implementation good bad,-1

this country not fucked any more than any other time recent history think about bit consider how bad and dark things the country would have seemed during any these episodes indo china war indo pak wars emergency operation blue star and the decade long sikh insurgency the kashmir uprising and the decade long kashmir insurgency babri masjid and the hindu muslim riots the financial crisis the early 90s with hung parliament facing kargil kandahar the parliament attack godhra the upa mega scandals including the utterly shameful commonwealth games fiasco etc things were always fucked this country the recent past but more importantly this has been the case for the past 300 years fact anything things are lot better now than what was the recent past are passing through period relative stability and prosperity less poor and more literate growing respectable rate given the state the world economy relatively stable government the center and enjoy relative peace both inside and outside the country don know about you but things look fairly peaceful when look around are doing well some other countries like china japan definitely but not doing that bad either you may think the consternations negative but think this very good sign that the parties are confronting each other and not letting issues fester beneath the surface only crop some other time the future worse forms better that talk shout out our differences rather than keep all repressed the core our conflicts the fact that don understand the other party value system liberals don understand where the conservatives are coming from and vice versa like even though live the same country inhabit two entirely different intellectual universes not understanding each other basic premises and priorities shout each other based the differences the conclusions reach what need have some empathy and try understand each other rather than get into cycle demonization and counter demonization that spiral out control the end the day long you don caricature the other party you find that all want the same things pretty much indians ,1

 through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft the managers have been sitting this pile rotting loans they didn have any reason tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were until rajan sent them that notice and forced them declare these bad loans not possible for the manger hide bad loans periodical review all the accounts done many the bad loans have till now been prevented from being classified npas refinancing them with short term loans avoid defaults the rbi has now asked them classify even such loans bad loans also under consortium lending even one member bank recognizes account npa all the banks are now required treat the account npa which was not the case earlier both these are major causes for the higher npa numbers the top management which responsible for the current mess and not just the front end manager who most the cases just following orders from the top ,-1

 kingfisher airlines borrowed amount 7000 crore from banks these loans were declared npa and the recoverable amount has come mere crore figure how much will recovered from the lakh crore the reason why this happened because mallaya used the trademarks and labels kingfisher collateral with the banks but the value these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt now this goes without saying that brand name would lose its value goes bankrupt why did banks took the risk taking kingfisher trademarks collateral the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation the bench headed chief justice asked all there this indian express report well that strange supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from newspaper report ,-1

 can add few points the banks dad chief manager public sector bank municipal town based branch managers chief managers don like having npas their books either the problem stems from the zonal level the zonal manager assigns quarterly yearly loan targets individual branches applications for larger and possibly good loans that are forwarded the zonal managers sit their desks for several weeks the borrower usually moves private bank now all that left smaller loan applications from shaky applicants local politicians who wants build schools engineering colleges and activists who would threaten write the this happened lot during the era the zonal management despite being sloppy still expects the branch managers meet the targets bms give the loan and hope would not become npa before they get transferred that the live bomb passed the new guy with bit negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management you can avoid declaring few loans npa for bunch quarters and don even want speak about the crazy ones that retire branch managers they loaning spree ,-1
while bad paper the current scenario actually better than expected the fact that banks have bad loans ancient fact life these loans extend many many places from large firms small farmers was always expected that some government would have intervene ecentually fix this the nda who has handle and fully expect them handle the issue itself resolved the bureaucrats and the bankers with the goi firmly the driving seat but the issue always the release bank funds largesse mainstay indian politics one form the other one the unspoken rules the game far the divestiture psus stronger oversight capital norms means constrain loans will help the clean banks will good thing and will allow for loan cycle occur the base healthy banking sector which can handle any future negative shock honestly this business expected good that people are upset but being upset won make difference since this essentially cyclical feature the larger economy and our banking private network rules which are followed divestment distance between center politics and psu management are the cure and they been the cure since the reform process started but haven been completed ,1

loans being written off from the books provisions being kept against bad debt doesn mean that there won recovery the whole raghuram rajan point the opening post doesn make sense that would like blaming government which enforces accurate reporting crimes for increase crime statistics the lowly bank managers have little say large loans the decision for the biggest npas are taken least general manager level some even chairman level one needs investigate these bad loans seize the assets willful defaulters and charge the real decision makers bank the whole issue that bankers being browbeaten give risky debt industrialists with political connections and the said industrialists refusing pay because they know that they have the connections and the power avoid being hit any action taken common bank bankers different ones from those who gave them loans ,-1

good eli5 but few bad points raghu just much blamed the doctor that operating you now that you drunk much that you crashed your bike the street manmohan and upa are the biggest culprits since they forced the banks give loans corporate entities that were close them and likely sonia and were the take supreme court when they get chance pull the biggies down looking you sonia and rahul case national herald case vasan eyecare they pull the last punches and thus feeding the too big fail mindset modi under modi term the incremental borrowing has practically shrunk they have legislative control the banks the banks report into the rbi from regulatory standpoint bank appointees coming from fin secy the only tangential link could modi merge and privatize all these banks sure that something that hope they big corporates they are not blamed they are sucking the system dry since they are being allowed can you blame tiger for eating your dog you cannot keep your dog the leash and big gun nearby not tiger fault its nature crooks will try steal money ,-1
great writeup thanks question big corporates say vijay mallya take huge loans and then are not able pay back and thus the write off what does the law here can catch the culprits and send them jail probably auction the properties that were kept guarantee while taking loan haven heard bigshot except sahara who sent jail for not paying back the money ,1
 always post this lecture article rajan the topic attitude borrowers towards the bank www outlookindia com article need change mind set 292696 the average interest rate loans the power sector today even while the policy rate the difference also known the credit risk premium largely compensation banks demand for the risk default and non payment since the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones every businessperson tainted the bad eggs the basket even comparing the rate the power sector loan with the average rate available the home loan obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because bank worries about whether they will recover loans reforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium power sector loans vis vis home loans would have large beneficial effects the cost finance perhaps much more than any monetary policy accommodation also highlights general problems like regulatory forbearance which was put place for temporary use but has been abused again and again www livemint com opinion rbctubqqfy7moqw4uytq7h why regulatory forbearance must end html recovery rates psbs are lower than private sector banks but the latter isn all that higher either need better bankruptcy laws deal with this kumbhakaran you may want add these links you find them useful insightful ,1
 top vijay mallya just resigned from united spirits and got payout million rs515cr not pedantic but couldn resist because intermittent ocd sorry how can they ask the banks waive off loans worth lakhs crores without having estimate how the big defaulters are the banks know who are the borrowers and rbi does not this not issue secondly the loans are not being waived cancelled forgiven forgotten that wrong and dangerous word use this context the loans are being written off what that means you say earlier you post that once the borrower has failed service the loan willingly due the things can control the banks write off called provisioning could partial full that their and balance sheet show the true reflection their own health rajan pushing for aggressive approach you mention later the post that does not mean that the borrower walks away the banks continue make efforts recover the money through notices public shaming selling assets borrower change management restructuring conversion into equity court cases sale loan arcs etc loan part that has been written off the bank and the bank manages recover the amount written back and becomes profit for that year interesting example here would the business cycle mid 90s early 2000s that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually worse shape than today but fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most the bank clients turned around and banks averted disaster most borrowers were commodity companies that time steel cement etc this time this not likely happen the mess wouldn clear itself they could have taken measure make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the banks lend their favored borrowers one the biggest defaulter unitech which people say gandhi family company rumor don ask for source group another big defaulter was close bsp jindals congress hcc pawar dlf huda vadra and they will benefit immensely from this loan write off and bailouts the government banks play the book which big ask they need not seize their fucking assets they have given personal guarantee seize their homes too what happens next short term government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive medium term hopefully this government puts professional management into the top layers the bank board and cmd and the rot contained happening bank baroda but again tall ask long term the relative size the psu bank will shrink pvt banks will become bigger one last point why are politicians reluctant reforming privatizing the banks because that the biggest tool granting favors corporates who turn are the biggest political donors the last last point there silver lining the bank problem stock problem the loans already given are going bad and need deal with what the system does not have fortunately the flow problem new money coming into the system and the investment cycle picks will have the money fund ,1

 colony for japan has nothing with freedom speech religion expression same for malaysia and south korea whose student protests were mainly against the yes singapore version democracy authoritarian spirit and curbs some freedoms but this only becomes relevant the government becomes evil enough warrant the exercise these freedoms this might also hold for the uae and what happened turkey basically what people fear will happen india under the rss ,-1
 pakistan virtual military dictatorship just discovered there word for such state khakistocracy ,-1
worst offender turkmenistan ,-1
 completely agree with ,1
 humble opinion those institutions are not creation the founding fathers they are result the rich diversity india india had oppressive dictatorship type leadership the number separatists movements would much higher pretty much separatists every state the only reason there aren more separatist movements that the various parties have hope that they will get chance power years think the emergency has continued longer think india would have further split the only way govern this large country democracy any other types governing methods would result many more separatist movements with democracy comes all other pillars democracy like freedom speech and independent press ,1

 middle east lol fucking lmao ,1
sanghi downvoting brigade was thing before lol sabha elections congi downvoting thing now don know how many people read randia but curious they really take seriously ,1
 think should careful when comparing india and china they don have absolute freedom speech true however the modern states india and china started the roughly the same gdp per capita but they have roughly five times bigger economy now what trying say people china may not have the kind freedom but they have food for everyone and that quite notable achievement ,1
but you can get killed for eating beef hindustan ,-1

just imagine had right wing been this powerful 1947 would have been royally fucked the cast has been set our institutions and polity are largely secular given india education level now and diversity bjp pip dream are just sand castles but just hope some good come out ,1
you right you don rampant practices untouchability cracking down free expresssion and the fostering religious extremism major political parties what joke ,1

this exactly what been thinking since long time over the years heard stories the form whatsapp group forwards discussion and facebook chains where you read how nehru was dick how gandhi ordered hanging bhagat singh and now you say nehru was good you called congress chut you won respect what nehru did what the legacy gandhi was every year right wing group stays power back year terms freedom expression and personal liberties fear that the time bjp voted out would made very deep damage our view freedom not permanent one sad that are the minority these days ,1
 not sure where begin you start off with nice statement about our founding fathers and looks nice when taken face value but when picked apart this not that much difference from very hollow india bestest every1 else worstest rhetoric freedom expression not everything and your post does not seem only about foe you are looking countries that have undemocratic regimes and making the claim that india better because has democracy not think many people disagree with the idea democracy itself your criticism japan and south korea makes sense all for the most part you are making huge generalizations about countries using single phrase you are looking long periods history and making judgements based their worst times not necessarily the present this particularly true both japan and south korea what matters the here and now middle east lol you are dismissing entire region with just lol care elaborate closet hatred for the muslim world because does show are you one those hypocritical liberals who see hinduism somehow innately more peaceful and superior where islam just one those evil modern religions that hinduism should never follow elsewhere the thread you just outright dismiss latin america because didn even bring latin america which keeps going from one military dictatorship another there are many indians who would give arm and leg live many the countries you have listed people start making such generalizations about india matter how truthful you will probably call them racist pakistani ignorant westerner lets give shot india 3rd world nation with religion with many problems that condones the oppressive social hierarchy caste institutionalizes misogyny and rape culture rampant corruption every level criminal mafia colluding with politicians and the police all over the country rule law that exists only name country filth and dirtiness everywhere sectarian conflict where hundreds die regularly villages living the stone age frighteningly low levels literacy and education and judiciary that both sluggish and corrupt the country beholden the mob and democracy merely thin varnish largely illiberal and sectarian mish mash communities that hate each other has some the worst average incomes and quality life standards the entire world even the government technically protects you with its great constitution becomes moot because society itself will lynch you how that for freedom expression try telling the families rationalists who got murdered try telling the same the jnu students the victims religious riots your post can summarized india better than countries worse than india yeah what that can call modi moron rahul pappu and kejri khujliwal and that there will knocks door for night fact don appreciate all does not really work out like that the real world maybe reddit you are safe unrelated modi but number states india people get arrested for social media posts two women arrested for facebook post mumbai shutdown granted bail html india professor held for cartoon ridiculing mamata asia india 17699304 does not matter the constitution protects you because society will not politicians religious groups and fanatics will able cause harm you before you even file fir and then dispose all the evidence justice will never happen compared democracies the developed world india still has very long way you strike person who not particularly well informed about the world and sounds like classic upper middle class indian liberal fact far say you are not that well informed about india either ,1
pretty weak points against japan and south korea some extent you have got there also you forgot mongolia,-1
and that why friend should fight for even slightest attack freedom speech nip the bud they say the reason that you allow government meddle with slightly within time will loose entirely for example had not fought hard against free basics our net neutrality would have certainly gone its not that don appreciate our freedom rather value much that don want lose ,1
what people don understand that india full fledged democracy with billion people thats like having serve 50000 computers with just one server all the same time and usa over there having problems with what about 300 million people mean come india managing people efficiently considering all the factors but wait you say china has more people but china dictatorship they tell you something you you can that india india actually doing well and even with such diverse population civil war has never been sparked thats not robust government don know what ,1
most your info about other countries seems come from 8th grade politics text seems even the first point china being oppressive well the truth not that oppressive now just the other day they realeased book owner who criticised ccp was released after questioning pakistan islamic democracy whatever india insists also china currently considered better place live than india don understand why pakistan miltary bad thing southe east and middle east countries laughs india for the same reasons you have listed and are currently war with each other whatever you insist sks consider americans there blessing influence japanese life minimal the best also they are still protecting from ,1

 also say that most western democracies have claimed these ideals equality freedom expression human rights time peace and prosperity now when they being tested well know the reality usa was quick abandon human rights and legal procedures pretty quickly after europe now seeing humanitarian and economic crisis with joblessness the rise and suddenly all sorts right wing nationalist parties have come the fore been dealing with lot more shit for lot longer while maintaining relatively peaceful multicultural society and making progress something carry forward ,1
 think the fact that most our history books end 1947 does not help reading india after gandhi these days and the amount hard work and intelligence put create democratic country where everyone equal has given new sense respect for the country and its beliefs ,1
these things look good paper not practiced actual try calling modi moron rahul pappu and kejri khujliwal with your legit facebook account ,-1
 agree however dont think japan deserves that list nither and singapore who are decide what form gov the best its working for them and the people are happy then great peoples happiness matters more than fos whatever other freedoms ,1

modi hasn still released his roll number for rest all bullshit ,0
fake degree fake entire political science lol ,-1
the least the degree looks fishy jumla best looks like coverup given modi track record education first claimed that was university topper then the universities and pmo started blocking rti requests and then has kept quite all these days before this degree was shown wont surprised this comes out fake ,1
 refusing comment which weird bjp has played itself which also weird there are oddities the certs relating names and course names which also weird ideally would compare with other certs issued the same period for names fonts and roll numbers the roll number register combo should allow take stand which has not done double weird know doubting anything right would mean bhakts stuffing any open mouth with laddus abuse you dont ask question but somehow should wait for more details from the guys that did the issuing the certificates records room needs put under surveillance summer too much stake things are getting hot ,-1
 will better the rti queries are answered rather than press conferences that will give ring authenticity the degrees and shut everyone forever ,1
call biased but just can buy that modi studied maybe some fakirchand college something associated with but certainly not the major colleges that said kejriwal top standard education has not really made him wiser person imo should have atleast confirmed his suspicions before launching all out attack politics makes the fools look saints and the wise look retards ,1
has also given the approval that the degree original ,1
 one finds weird that the degree was awarded for entire political science ,-1
 man who actually gives funda about cosmetic surgery ganesha head cant more than 10th pass for and from gujarat univ cant believe for one sec,1
actually there should reasonable and substantial reasons suspect modi degrees the first place the aap have not proved that they have reasonable doubt but merely threw some allegations and are now stonewalling since the relevant degrees have been made public also the reasons why aap rti applications were turned down were because exhaustive requests that are simply tedious and without point like asking for the original application form modi etc this similar frivolous vexatious litigations that simply waste time and frustrate the defendants and have other objectives aap trying throw much muck see something sticks modi ,1
 predicted finally delhi university has confirmed the details just gujarat university had earlier delhi university clarifies modi was awarded degree 1979 html this should make everything clear normally however this whole drama due politics rather than any genuine concern over the degree expect congress and aap will just make the low effort argument that all this evidence fake cook some truly fake evidence their own and keep copy pasting these same allegations till the media gets tired ,1
 unfortunate that have clarify narendra modi qualifications shame that have clarify why unfortunate shameful what bad about asking for citations ,-1
 was right when kejriwal upped the ante and showed the country how petty can even over non issues finally the degree has been reveled dispel all doubts wasn expecting amit shah personally get involved though the bjp should have asked some delhi state leader like harshvardhan show this just giving kejriwal unneeded legitimacy national politician way achieved his objectives with this drama ,1
 literally degree who the fuck cares you have degree not can you even get employed with all for academic research and the arts but has zero impact one ability perform competently ,1
goddam kejriwal pulling some donald trump level shit here ,-1
fucking madarchods are now claiming that the degree forged top kek ,-1
 really hoped that the bjp ministers had better things than respond some stupid trolling kejriwal the common man doesn give shit about collage degrees real fake ,-1
 this whole degree fiasco don understand one thing have many almost illiterate politicians mean take sonia for moment she herself has idea what are her degrees but look the respect she has our country because gandhi dynasty sure there not going essay competition next election unless that what kejri bhai trying and kejri bhai won win that either you look politics only modi far far ahead from kejri bhai for one knows how run state the very least which think kejriwal don want only want sit the center before starts culminating corruption from country may abusing contest might see him clear winner ,1
the degree displayed may fake may not whichever you believe largely about your political leanings absolutely sure much more needs released like other documents which show modi registered external student etc and verification that the degrees shown are real and not fake and bjp may agree allow that too soon however all this sideshow with real relevance unless there forgery involved doubt that ,1

 bjp congress secretive team players not single word about the fcra amendment was spoken that day just like that super important law that will change how our political parties are funded was accepted the lok sabha proof any needed that bjp congress are different from each other they join hands and throw out democracy benefited them the ‚Äòjumla‚Äô that escaped not just jumla but the likes scam that this very bjp govt chased congress out power 2005 then modi abruptly announced that the gujarat state petroleum corporation gspc had discovered trillion cubic feet gas basin that the bjp promptly renamed the deendayal west area block which would generate revenue worth lakh crore for india everyone including the state and central administrations well subject experts was astonished this fantastic claim true such find would have made india energy self sufficient must for any country aspiring for super power status modi‚Äô announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind the 2002 riots potential prime ministerial candidate fact given how events unfolded abundantly clear that the announcement like everything else modi does was just another exaggerated publicity stunt modiji pays heed exclusively his own mann baat thus ignored the field report and forced gspc ahead with the project because this gspc borrowed nearly 000 crore from different public and private sector banks and what does india have return nothing but the issue not just about modiji‚Äô gaseous exaggerations also about diversion public funds and corruption after coercing gspc ahead with drilling basin modi forced partner with company named geo global now here‚Äô the interesting bit geo global was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with gspc the time entering into the agreement with gspc geo global‚Äô capital was reportedly measly 200 week after the agreement its capital mushroomed 000 crore its report for the year ended march 2015 tabled state assembly this year cag had pulled gspc for its lack experience overseas operator the delay execution the work committed resulted cost escalations overseas blocks result the company had incurred expenditure 757 crore for surrendered blocks which 734 crore has been written off the apex auditor noted was this public money diverted fund modi ‚Äô extravagant 2014 election campaign does this not merit independent high level judicial probe and even more interestingly when the screws were tightened vijay mallya for defaulting 9000 crore why gspc not being subject similar treatment why that instead its managing director was rewarded with appointment the director the national informatics centre state petroleum corporation deity gspc however desperately the bjp may sycophantically defend modi the bitter reality that under him corruption was rampant gujarat consider how gave 250 acres land restricted wildlife zone cronies the current gujarat for less than crore html similarly modi gave public land for the mundra sez ece which was worth 1500 per square metre for pittance anything between that why for years the cag was deliberately denied access numerous files gujarat and that also why under modi lokayukta was not appointed for years his avatar prime ministerial candidate modi had famously argued ‚Äúmain khata hoon khaane deta hoon‚Äù seems the truth different reports cag gspc 2016 20public sector undertakings report 2016 pdf cag gspc 2015 pdf cag gspc 2011 pdf ,1

 need strong national party keep the ever expanding bjp check last checked congress was the strong national that needed checked for corruption and abuse power,1
more than strong opposition india needs sensible opposition who don oppose bills because they want make the ruling party look bad when the next elections come even the gandhis are gone their lackies will still remain would prefer complete overhaul the congress party ,1
yes definitely upa cabinet was much better than the current nda cabinet with the dynastical leadership that have qualms with people have chosen bjp predominantly for its leader namo and rejected the congress for similar reason they say army sheep lead lion better than army lions lead sheep ,1
congress has other leaders well like digvijay kapil sibal the choices lol ,1
they have and get some fresh face otherwise bjp going power forever ,1
yes would definitely consider voting for congress right now with its dynasty not even option can say will definitely vote for congress pragmatically would see who will replace the gandhis and what views they espouse myriad issues but expect dynasty less congress would match own center right views ,1
 wouldn mind voting for congress since that would mean less stringent rules government offices like used congress days more online tracking work done and other would make goverment jobs fun again ,1
 have always felt india any democratic country needs strong opposition india needs strong congress but india does not need the gandhis gandhi free congress not good enough for vote for the congress congress also needs project strong leaders ,1
 the leader shashi tharoor think about but long the stupid family around won even think voting for them ,-1
 not worried about bjp growth they had win assam assam just another hindutva laboratory bubbling under the surface like karnataka and gujarat were especially with the bangladeshi bogeyman what worried about 2019 because bjp only achievement this term has been opposition while the country wants shove them out bihar and delhi lossew the states that were crucial them winning being prime indicators there doesn seem any alternative ,1
this post smells journalist shit ,-1
will vote priyanka joins ,0
yes think kicking the gandhis out and seriously reinventing themselves after the lessons they hopefully learned this time round would improve the party significantly ideal world though which this not mind would consider realistically would probably wind voting for independent candidate ,1
gandhis are not the problem with congress they are merely the mascots congress steeped corrupt people from bottom ranks the top the entire congress party was die and fresh new untainted people were start new congress might consider them but until they have the likes pawars scindias singhs shuklas basically their entire leadership congress will keep looting india fuck that even when these shitlords are not power they keep corrupting the system from ministers they become brokers for corrupt babus you need permit something illegal meet with digvijay singh hand him briefcase cash and get your work done the right babu office ,-1
 would you consider voting for the congress the dynasty gone this will never happen has been evident even from the recent loss they had having said that would still skeptical vote for them even after they eliminate the dynasty gandhis would still indirectly controlling their leaders when they come power their reach and influence within the congress cant eliminated totally ,-1
 will never vote for congress bjp ,0
 hindu feel that the secularism politics has often become tool for minority appeasement hold the view that indian culture inherently tolerant and secular don indulge conversion and believe that god can attained though many ways the same cannot said the abrahamic faiths who proclaim exclusivity and indulge conversions family itself has been victim where one relatives converted for reasons unknown bjp the only viable alternative who seem secular while preserving our traditions they don seem extreme painted the liberals and leftists seriously feel our population will echo sentiments and remain true bjp unless they indulge extreme corruption bigotry ,1
this moot point gandhi mukt congress likely dmk free the karunanidhi family rjd without lalu prasad yadav and his sons for national comparison bjp without rss and give the gandhis too much importance congress has lot other things wrong with them policies massive corruption political opportunism over national interests etc the blame for this also goes various second rung and regional leaders can replace them all ,-1
not million years their leftist economic policies drove our economy into the ditch and kept indians poor even bjp isn good enough but least they aren viciously and blindly destructive these traitors ,-1
gandhis plus all the top stooges like digvijay chidu etc yea looks like never voting congress ,1
 india seriously needs strong opposition for our democracy remain vibrant india seriously needs well informed voters who have got some thinking capacity their own and have guts call bullshit face,1
indian politics ever changing but guess used the idea that the congress will hang somehow they can manage reinvent themselves completely like political parties other bipartisan systems have managed they would have vote that would involve complete removal and prosecution the old guard and dynasty and emergence new youth leaders whoever taps the youth vote actual youth would well imo the situation stands now would vote for shashi tharoor assumed leadership and put his own people visibly ,1
 need strong national party keep the ever expanding bjp check last checked congress was the strong national that needed checked for corruption and abuse power,1
 vote for hindutva unless congress can guarantee that never vote for edit wow downvotes for honest answer ,1
hopefully congress should not replaced another corrupt party they must stay with their development agenda but less likely seeing their arrogance ,-1
 would vote congress they start leaning more pro free market with their economic policies they did well upa and early 90s however lately they have gone too far left for with stuff like the gas subsidy mnrega etc etc gandhis are ruling not ,1
the gandhis are the only factor keeping them together with them gone the congress would immediately break into dozens splinter groups heck the congress loses few more elections especially the next lok sabha elections might happen with the gandhis still present ,0
the way bjp has reached out the educated crowd and their commitment robust party leadership unparalleled don think congress can the near future get anywhere near bjp work ethics and determination ,1
 the gandhis are gone you won have congress they are the glue holding the party ,0
 way the minority thing really creeps out cant vote for congress for blindly supporting minorities have seen the reservation quota politics lot against the congress party this agenda ,1
how come there was such alarmism about strong opposition while congress was ruling india for years mani shankar aiyar pointed out congress still strong ever think need credible opposition the congress and they should cut down size bjp doing good job that ,1
 because then would voting for sycophants who kept gandhi power just because suited them let them into oblivion ,0

 generally agree fan religious ideology any sense can hard have the conversation about problems with ideology without that creeping include people individuals general read that islam espouses some shitty things and shouldn act like that isn problem say the same thing when christin extremists bomb abortion clinics both have problematic language and views think the differentiating factor that islam codified the law islamic nations the beliefs are backed the force law most western christin majority nations the law mainly secular you can still get really poisonous messages about homosexually but the law punishes you for acting rather than protecting our directly participating think have fewer problems without the theocracy but nothing going stop guy who decided needs off bunch people finds repulsive and that brings arguments over gun control which while different thing but have large segments the public who won even have the discussion ,1

let talk road paint from what remember from 2003 laborers literally painted the road instead using methods like thermoplastic painting wprov sfla1 thermoplastic markings are applied using specially designed vehicles usually thermoplastic marking mode should apply with equipment called road marking machine coating traffic lines and the road paint needs preheating device commonly called preheater the thermoplastic mix heated trucks about 200 ¬∞ 400 ¬∞ before being fed the application apparatus this often screed box ribbon gun immediately after the thermoplastic has been applied glass beads are laid onto the hot material that they embed before the plastic hardens these beads provide initial retroreflection the marking wears during use and the initial beads are lost the beads mixed with the binder are uncovered providing long term retroreflectivity most thermoplastic produced white and yellow colors but other colors such red may also produced the warm climate areas the thermoplastic markings can last years however snowplows can damage the thermoplastics which would limit the usage the cold climate areas there other methods tools they can use paint the roads too refer them here wprov sfla1 apart from obvious questions they think modi doesn know the roads are ugly mess and why these people such half hearted shit the more important question why don they just invest some form surface marking painting practice that has longevity instead having paint every year the regular paint gets worn out constant traffic dust and rains this what never got about india even thailand and georgia have better metalled roads with better signage texture and demarcations than what the glitch ,1
maybe should create vvip ministry whose sole job drive around india quick calculation total road network length 429 year term therefore 085 per year 2326 per day lets say 200 per day possible about cars should don even need people the car just one those googlemaps camera systems ,1

 all these people angry with the government about this what alternative are you suggesting genuinely curious hear kashmiri pandits are being threatened pilgrims and migrant camps are being attacked crpf men and even their families are pelted with stones and threatened mobs most the people politicians and separatist leaders openly support violent islamist militant groups and members like burhan wani who had openly advocated murder indian government officials police military men and even civilians kashmiri pandit colonies this the environment kashmir separatism has always been prevalent and ever since the insurgency started animosity towards india kashmiri pandits indian soldiers etc has also been prevalent being soft and letting mobs riot pelt stones and allowing further exodus kashmiri hindus not going solve the problem using iron hand won solve the underlying issue either but will least bring some safety and normalcy ,-1
this fucking government going turn kashmir into the kashmir the 90s unless anyone noticed the number incidents kashmir had fallen all time low now all that decade peace going down the drain never seen more uneducated government life you have all these stupid trolls who have never seen what kashmir was like the 90s who keep asking for india implement iron hand ,-1

 standard team league thinking starting cook over kelce this week talent wise there doubt that kelce the better option but feel like the difference game scripts warrents giving cook longer look this match feels like going run the ball against historically last season very soft run defense also finished near the top the list right behind seattle for fewest receptions yards and tds receivers the script set for kcs backs pound the ball all game and kelce might used for just safety valve jax this game set favor the passing game more than feel like will use the run early the game set play action against jax linebacker core that isn great coverage solid against the run though cook and rodgers have had some good chemistry the preseason and cobb covered the slot expect cook see some work and even some red zone targets got kelce started but curious get the communities thoughts this either way think cook going surprise some experts and see his stock rise solid waiver option that available most leagues ,1

 what would releasing video footage achieve the people that aren‚Äô convinced official announcement the dgmo will dismiss and video footage photos ‚Äúdoctored‚Äù just easily this absolutely correct the intention doubt the narrative amount evidence going convince anyone otherwise second the fencing along the loc all indian til this true were there pakistani contributions all towards the fence that unbelievable and finally very possible that modi lulled the pakistanis into false sense security with the indus waters treaty bluff and the let fight war poverty instead speech kozhikode they may have raised alert levels for week following the attack but those would been dialed down once they were convinced that india was all talk and action was masterpiece deception and timing maybe but all the things you said far this was far the weakest would assume this just modi being passive aggressive his foreign policy instead playing some diabolical chess with pakistan the tactical impact may negligible but the strategic and political implications are immense india has now shown that she can ‚Äì and will ‚Äì respond provocations with force your opinion you think has happened earlier the congress said something week the effect raids happened during congress time also didn parrot around after something gen deepak kapoor said want know how much their statements are valid and how many are invalid asking you this because after there were similar questions surgical strike ece began coming out something that you can really see today the idsa has written good pieces advocating for more muscular policy against terrorists following which you can read here 11theisraeliwayandrelevanceforindia sscrajiv 261109 modi initial attempts diplomacy with pakistan were ensure that peace was given chance that‚Äô why invited sharif his inauguration and made ‚Äúsurprise visit‚Äù lahore for further talks after the pathankot attack took the unprecedented step allowing pakistani investigation team into the base gave the pakistanis chance prove that things had indeed changed and that state support for terrorism would cease that turned out not the case the investigators had the nerve suggest that the attack was false flag operation orchestrated india yes india needs have the carrot and the stick while dealing with any its more antagonistic partners neighbors more concerned with the fact that our troops are getting killed ways troops not get killed during peacetime these kinds things being the norm are unacceptable india shouldn allow this area thorn its side any longer marks sea change from the previous policy seeking cessation hostilities through diplomatic means alone and persisting with the notion that diplomacy would work one day even though had failed for the past seventy years contradict you bit opinion the current government for various reasons elections indirect message pakistan whatever opts publicize their diplomatic and foreign policy actions through the media and other sources has been the policy india far understated its approach through foreign policy think india becoming more overtly aggressive now control the narrative easier since the tide opinions that matter public media political can always turn instant this may advised ill advised tell you which context this would ill advised currently india flexed muscles and attacked terrorists the pok some time later group carried out some attacks urban india and caused catastrophic damage life property and morale what would india they claimed show courage and pro activity dismantling hostile forces our backyard but what these forces recoup and attack would deeply humiliating and shocking correct this risk always exists this surgical strike isn end point india needs play its cards smarter and the worst part don think the indian government even has positive experience controlling the narrative could wrong this could all blow its face instant and the entire image they cultivating could pop was would publicize the surgical strikes and compare the attacks that pakistan military itself faced the pns mehran kamra the nfwp from terrorists that did not happen hoped modi would like india and pakistan face attacks their military from these terrorists hope that our mission helps innocent soldiers both sides the border from threats life sounds reasonable head playing pakistani emotion and love for raheel sharif who credit where its due stomped and killed terrorism plaguing karachi much could their soldiers died shareef took retaliatory action indian soldiers died modi took retaliatory action fairs fair right just want you address this one thing your post the false narrative that the attackers were anguished kashmiris fighting indian oppression entirely possible but unless there ready proof for choose assume its false narrative enjoy your gold buddy ,1

 don think many people here have problem with the military carrying our operations what they have problem with the bragging that followed covert operation should have remained secret but with all the bragging and official confirmation pakistan will forced retaliate appease the public and save face the only reason even know about this strike because the bjp government wants impress its bhakt voters now has escalated the entire war with pakistan for few percentage points any upcoming elections ,-1
the whole drama surrounding the surgical strikes golden opportunity for investigative journalist joint team journalists from india and pakistan preferably containing cyril almeida and sreenivasan jain should investigate the matter truth about the strikes will then come out the whole release the footage release the footage smacks low effort erf ers and get detailed eyewitness accounts that your job journalists already report praveen swami out pakistani soldiers were killed want detailed report their death one indian soldier under detention pakistan interview him whichever reporter can fully get the bootom this incident pulitzer waiting him her like seymour hersh press lurkers get going your job fast ,1
 think the has conclusively settled this matter for anyone who would interested debating opinion that has fact put more time effort and thought into articulating this than the vast majority people who dispute the official version ,1
 false argument ‚Äô still skeptical this was probably regular border raid the sort that have been happening for years not ‚Äúsurgical strike‚Äù the army claims the difference that they chose publicize this time known fact that ech and dee huge factor that nation but the end what will work what good friend used say give peace chance ,1
 however india fact carried out cross border surgical strike terrorist facilities and not pakistani military posts would paradigm shift india‚Äô war against terrorist and militant organizations would also boast the perception that india‚Äô asymmetrical warfare capability further along than many may perceive doesn know shit just speculating,1
all your counterpoints can condensed these lines trust govt trust army don trust pakistan particularly funny don believe the strike happened because the indian army does not have the capability rebuttal believe they have the capability because believe the strike happened ,1
the dumbest thing this whole discussion the military prerogative provide not any details could have chosen altogether not talk about the covert operation just mention that has been done may have chosen the former and not the later for whatever analysis and planning has this always ongoing live situation and not year old record which has only historical relevance military has need provide proof anyone other than the government which accountable since democracy there civilian oversight the military through the elected government about what has not carried out video their operations can compromise the identity individuals involved details their modus operandi capabilities etc and sane military will voluntarily put such information public domain and there nothing that will realistically achieved indulging chutiya demands anyway rabble makers all unrelated note its almost like asking video proof honeymoons ,-1
brilliant points and summary just would like point out that was overt not covert action,1
 false argument bullshit pakistani diplomats claim that the border heavily fenced and there way incursion possible without detection pakistanis have ridiculous logic terrorists from pakistan could infiltrate the loc through heavy security and firing then why can the highly trained indian elite squads enter these domains ,-1
 want provide proof nation that refused accept dead bodies its own soldiers calling them local militants and later went award nishan haider two them really ,1
the very fact that you had write this comment means how rogue our media and others have given that need provide explanation media will sell country for their own gain,1
great post course there are enough glimmers evidence that the attack did take place but that shouldn reason shout down people who ask questions either they will vindicated and expose cover they will made look stupid which likely the case here that healthy democracy ,1
 close friend mine army officer posted told that the army had issued orders couple days after the uri attack all units send family members home this was just regular operation there way the army would take such precautions was well thought out and well executed operation real shame that some politicians are more interested scoring petty brownie points ,1
brilliant point point breakdown one other argument making the rounds false argument okay maybe the strikes took place but should have been kept secret and deniable there good reason for dgmo make statements about covert actions except for bjp score political points there are massive number reasons make strike like this public exposes pakistan bluster just tough talk for all their talk being high alert for indian troop movement along the loc after the uri attack they didn even see coming massively boosts morale within the armed forces morale which has been getting steadily lower our bases kept getting hit while they were not allowed take charge the offensive the troops are also being vilified the media national and international while trying control spiral violence srinagar fueled pakistan propaganda machine makes the best use pakistan blunder overreaching and outmaneuvers them pakistan has its hands tied now after making bold statements about defending against indian adventurism aggression and denying that any terrorist camps even exist the region that they have the support their government pakistan has left itself publicly admissible out can either promise retaliation for strikes thereby confirming the existence such terror bases deny the strike and claim ignorance any bases the area releasing statements and evidence the strikes india makes pakistan look weak and incompetent defense while also making the point that pakistan harbors terrorists and uses them proxy war against india manner that exceeds just providing moral and diplomatic support they have claimed the past calls pakistan bluff threats start nuclear conflict their nuclear arsenal while still being very real and implicit threat longer their impenetrable shield striking within pok and then making public india has taken control the escalatory ladden you said earlier out the open for everyone see which leads the next point makes public the strategic shift indian policy dealing with cross border infiltration and terrorism this now means that india controls the play events and that infiltration will actively fought against taking the fight the terror outposts and leaving open the possibility even striking training camps situated further inland this means that india will make pakistan work and pay for every infiltration attempt literally not just pay terms revenge and bloodshed pakistan will need actually spend more time money resources manpower actual defense and surveillance near these bases their terror outposts will have constantly vigilant and more resources dedicated keeping eye out for incoming strikes the future this very different from the past where the outposts had nothing worry about till they crossed the border and their entire focus was offensive not defensive nature points out very little fencing the pakistani side because they never even felt the need defend themselves but that will all change now terrorists will not sleep peacefully their beds they will possibly make more mistakes and every new person recruited keep watch patrol their perimeter potential vulnerability too accidentally leaked info paid informant mole many these will make increasingly expensive and difficult maintain multiple such bases leading demoralized terrorists demoralized pakistani troops demoralized and disillusioned pakistani public pakistan currently damage control mode firing off more propaganda than artillery and trying pooh pooh the stories the strikes indian propaganda but inaccuracies their accounts will begin add and morale will definitely take hit everyone the pakistani side currently denial but that expected ultimately again makes the government look dishonest incompetent and erodes their imaginary moral high ground that they lay claim strengthens the indian public support for the government this definitely well deserved win for the bjp but more importantly makes the indian public lot more unified behind their central government regardless who was power when such action was taken there are certainly plenty who question the narrative and events but there definite surge public approval favor retaliation for uri and the strikes themselves regardless their position the who how where why covert overt bragging courting war etc this demonstrates among other things that the goi proactive that was receptive the outrage about uri across the nation that was willing take stand such attacks indian sovereignty demonstrates india ability operate within the bounds previous agreements and treaties while still taking decisive action defend itself and not being enslaved those treaties pakistan has always played victim when came any border related issue and deny any involvement previous incursions from their side meanwhile india hamstrung restrictive treaties preventing military retaliation for numerous actions carried out pakistan and its proxy fighters till now this deft navigation not altering the loc while striking terrorist camps falls well within the bounds the simla agreement and the charter surgical strikes across loc line with shimla agreement and charter 3026586 html exploring this avenue publicly means that india can now freely continue perform such strikes the future without invoking any backlash from most other nations and getting active support from several now let assume that the strikes took place but the government kept absolutely secret the outcome not making the strikes public knowledge would have been quite disadvantageous the whole india maintains deniability for aggressive action great but pakistan will constantly play the victim anyway portray cross border terrorism domestic rebellion foment unrest and paint india oppressive bully state committing atrocities kashmir very little advantage here while the strike killed handful terrorists and prevented few attacks the near future would fail adequately capitalize that victory other terror outfits and individual members such organisations may remain unaware and unafraid pakistani turf terrorists sleeping soundly before attempting border crossing isn good for indian defense maintaining state combat ready vigilance and tension impossible for more than few days for all but the most highly trained soldiers demoralizes indian troops they would feel abandoned the govt and the people left deal with bloodthirsty militants all themselves without any chance take action and preempt such attacks the indian soldiers continue the only ones who sleep fear with the fatigue constant vigilance making them weaker while the enemy gets stronger indian silence taken for weakness emboldens our enemies india seen soft target home and abroad india loses control the narrative the few who would aware the covert action the other side could later alter the narrative they have done several times the past and claim india committed atrocities and crimes pakistani territory and killed civilians blaming raw and other agencies and using justify further attacks several years the future the context and events this time would have faded from the public mind and india would the diplomatic back foot having either deny the action ever took place and look guilty forced justify such action and remind the public that was retaliation for uri not random unprovoked attack better claim upfront and connect the two events inextricably forever india retaliates for uri massacre today lot better than india denies committing war crimes pok years later when the conspiracy theorists would have had plenty time concoct alternate narrative pakistan would continue have the facade nuclear shield despite successful strike until challenged head publicly pakistan claims would continue hold weight pakistan retains control the escalatory ladder pakistan bluff not called and continues project the image competent military pakistan retains the facade harboring terrorists its soil what terrorists public acknowledgement shift the policy strategic restraint indian public loses faith the government not knowing about any retaliation would mean that the indian public would just have another item list complain about how the government all talk action critics the government perceived restraint would continue make the government look weak and ineffective bjp would crucified the public eye for not taking stronger measures because the public wouldn know about the strike the voice the people would appear have been ignored future governments would unlikely continue the shift strategy reluctance take control the offensive would persist continued veil secrecy would mean that their efforts would unnoticed while the costs and risks such operations would for little political benefit ,1
also tangentially support your first argument the fact that even there was attack claiming one itself bold diplomatic move challenging the other side escalate especially during times heightened tensions ,1
let face the isi and its indian supporters will never ever accept the truth even video the operation released this has become prestige issue for them and like with ishrat jehan they will never accept the truth already those who believe the strike happened are being called bhakts the larger issue how deal with this fifth column ,0
lol the downvotes are from modibots,1
 completely agree with whatever you have posted only issue with the chest thumping and increasing politicisation the issue modi took bold step everyone appreciated then the bjp went overboard with all their sources leaking incredulous information and now you see them using this plank for the next elections what does lead even more politicisation from the other parties who are obviously feeling insecure they can one this especially when comes army which enjoys the electorate respect tactically and strategically this was excellent political handling was utter shit ,1
some thoughts been having the indian army apolitical organization the extent that there are laws restricting army men from expressing political views while service that widely held more credible such matters than the political class the elected government when the director general himself not the defense minister bjp spokesman called that press conference should have been accorded respect not immediate suspicion while the army has had fake encounters and other crimes before there precedent seniormost army figures lying the public serious matter like this while have right question our armed forces the degree suspicion this case was unwarranted and unnecessary and belies the agenda the critics rather than the army most the people having any cursory knowledge about such operations know that detailed information photos video etc are rarely released due being sensitive confidential military matter that could compromise the capabilities the armed forces and intelligence agencies revealed they can shared with relevant authorities but not the general public because that way these secrets will exposed the enemy well was very irresponsible doubt the dgmo insinuate that the attacks were fake and ask for detailed evidence what apparent just under the surface but which one will say out loud that this whole controversy only due politics the modi government started capitalizing the goodwill from the surgical strikes for election campaigns yjr left wing parties politicians and followers are trying counter the bjp political mileage calling the surgical strikes fake and the army lying modi stooges matter shame that has even come this but the media publishing eyewitness accounts from pok still regarded rss conspiracy ishrat jehan innocent girl the terror boat incident staged yakub memon heroic whistleblower burhan wani youth icon etc sections the liberal class india ,1
you might want add the list pakistani denials the following they have denied and continued deny the presence pakistani army regulars 1947 they denied any knowledge about the existence osama before his death continues deny any knowledge his presence just stone throw away from their biggest staff college army cantonment coincidentally the has released evidence neptune spear and fact takes action against soldiers who even leak info kargil they denied the presence nli unit regulars refused accept their bodies but later gave them the fucking nishan haider their pvc how stupid that lastly pakistan has denied the presence terrorist infrastructure their soil admitting these strikes something they will never ever how can they admit attacks phantom sites they have maintained does not even exist pakistan kejriwal the congress and the communists are opportunist scumbags putting party and politics over the army and national security ,-1
this whole denial thing actually worked out well for kills their narrative indian aggression while alloys conduct similar operations the future without international scrutiny ,1
 the director general military operations dgmo made official announcement stating the statement offers plausible deniability crossing the loc one could argue for strikes such cros border shelling etc the main implication crossing the border during these terrorist attacks and infiltration attempts have recovered various stores including gps and items that clearly indicate their origins pakistan which when closely examined also leaves hazy which infiltration attempt when and where material was recovered would say this plausible official deniability purpose the strategy was let jingoistic media the talking without any official source ,1
why the media jerking themselves over this incident which may may not happened have millions other social evils report about ,-1
 this was not just regular border action that uninformed commentators and analysts are speculating those were tactical nature and were planned and conducted the initiative local commanders how you know that you can compare between this operation and the previous operations you knew the details the previous operations and have knowledge about the previous operations therefore any comparison pure speculation the sole reason why this time different that indian government made the existence and the details military operation public could have kept secret but indian government chose reveal the details let address the video evidence indian army publicly claimed that they have the video the cross border strike now per your argument the video evidence will not change pakistan stance denial they will continue deny even reveal the videos the act revealing the video contents will have effect pakistan reaction then why reveal the existence the video army could have stayed silent about the existence such evidence india conducts cross border strike like has done before and makes public within few hours which hasn done before india also publicly claims record the video the strike while also knowing that revealing such video would have effect pakistan state denial how make sense these contradictions well actions and utterances after the military strike indicate that india doesn want outright war case did want war with its nuclear armed neighbor then the genius our policy makers beyond the human realm beyond the understanding mere mortals this entire business was conducted making public the military operation making public that have the video for the domestic audience there impending polls two major states there discontent among students dalits minorities marathas patels how unify these warring factions why not make military operation public india should decide using military means influence domestic politics precedent worth setting ,-1
you missed the most important question how know whether the targets are actually terrorists launchpad can simply house village hut forest simply launching surgical strike something you define launchpad does not mean actual terrorists were hit the second important question how many innocent people were killed injured this surgical strike assuming there some meaningful difference between surgical strike and plain ordinary strike does mean innocents were killed injured how know ,1
neutral observer here wandered here after newspaper story and reddit thread and followed with bit research here are two cents nytimes and wapo story noticed that the visit the border was under pakistan army supervision and journalist posed any independent question the locals not think army would leave any bodies around and terrorist camps lying around when journalists visit they were pushing pretty unbelievable agenda and journalists did not any investigative journalism when comes pakistan wise untrust them they even denied usama bin laden presence why would indian dgmo issue statement they hit launch pads territory under their control understand there are lots sensitivities due both being nuclear states and hence the statement being mild avoid annoying various powers this was the same terminology used when india hit myanmar camps another major point was that some other nations were immediately briefed india definitely hit pakistani side these strikes ,1
the real question why are people worked that some are questioning the army narrative believe the questions are relevant since bjp will use poll issue the upcoming elections ,1

for all the doubters next time the army conducts such operation they should tag along and watch with their own eyes instead asking for video footage ,1
the army will never release the footage and people keep forgetting one the biggest reason this was not gun battle this was slaughter the army did not lose even single soldier the entire operation and there reason for this the terrorist are still humans and they would have considered themselves safe there they had reason wary they would have been unarmed infact they would sleeping you really want see footage our soldiers killing people their sleep because that what you will see the only difference between these and any other people sleeping would the intelligence that have that these are terror launch pads pakis here are win win situation don show the footage see told you they didn hit show india violated our border and killed innocent people nope best will get are the still photos dead terrorists and unconvinced politicians and trolls ,1

great post one simple question though this enough put pressure pakistan army change even contemplate changing current policy using non state actors against india because all said and done they who control that country domestic foreign defence and kashmir policies ,1
good post people need realise that government can really declare something out thin air has geopolitical consequences and pretty sure the decision have surgical strike and also declare about this attacks was well thought and was made pretty experienced people who actually know what they are doing whether not this was right wrong completely different issue personal opinion this they attacked responded really well celebrated and this got really good public response which isn wrong imo matter closed let get back diplomacy instead escalating this have lot more better things worry about ,1
 agree that the indian govt has hinted strongly that they did cross the border and there chance that decent sized operation did occur however there can and never will 100 proof indeed hope these ops will always deniable and based the pakistani reactions suspect that they just sucked because otherwise they would lose face front their public pakistani establishment are certainly capable playing this game for their domestic gallery for example after osama killing americans they basically denied all knowledge the raid and they would have denied the american role wasn for the crashed chopper whereas suspect they were aware the raid and had bartered osama life for something the other ,1
you forgot add pakistan army and govt and media also rejected for like one month that afghan taliban head mulla mansur was killed baluchista march 2016 and they kept fooling their country with fake technical issues like the dna wasn matched with afghan head mulla mansur and shit like that confirmed that and did world media but pakistan being pakistan you know dick lied the world ,-1

 disclaimer this was intended response cynicism expressed leonorachristine but their comment got voted down into oblivion copy pasting for better visibility think all lies the perspective because india technologically less advanced than lot western countries has lot less baggage and easier move cleaner energy sources currently the indian government driving electrification through all villages india you look 2016 and has already been years since india became independent even then there lack such basic amenity however the energy ministry here doing stupendous job you could look the facebook page the concerned minister who shares electrification stats for every week india still energy deficit there need even build the infra that would provide for the energy needs the country adopting clean energy very easy for that way modi trying build world wide presence ratifying the paris climate agreement and following through implement would give his government greater foothold world politics india already ramping its effort become part nsg gain much more access nuclear energy already special place the nsg members are free trade nuclear material with india the way see quite possible that modi will follow through his words and receives technological support india would fact lead the world moving clean energy and you mentioned toilets doing great lot work about that too ,1

the fact that such questions are only asked after some publicity stunt the bjp puts question the very integrity asking such questions you did want know what people really think him this poll should have been done when anandiben patel resigned gujarat should have been done when parliament was held session after session without passing single bill because refused respond might also have been asked the recent times when riot like situation was going both karnataka and tamilnadu over the question sharing kavery river water and our chose speak bjp rally kozhikode which kerala the only other south indian state than tamilnadu karnataka centre has essentially suspended democracy calling elected government null and void states bjp plays horse trading trying buy mps from other parties shakes hand with the very people that congress dealt with and was criticised for the bjp all this being left uncriticised and minded because the media and much india stands awe guy who rises fame riots murders and intrigues ,1

little known facts jaipur was one the first planned cities india you look the old city layout you impressed chaura rasta literally wide road was wide and spacious even time when there were cars even today community rajputs lives pakistan bordering barmer they are called the umarkote amarkot rajputs because there other sizable rajput community pakistan they have come india marry and because they rajputs pakistanis don mess with them ganga canal now known indira gandhi nahar pariyojana was project started maharaja ganga singhji bikaner the 30s brought water via aqueduct from punjab the plains western rajasthan afaik was the first such major irrigation project india transformed the border areas completely lots sikhs from punjab also moved there for the farming opportunities the bishnois jodhpur area are arguably the world first true environmentalists they not allow cutting trees shooting animals salman khan case once local king wanted cut trees for firewood for his camp the people tied themselves the trees many were killed the king but the rest still refused think rajasthan the only state with legal opium afeem shops,1
there this place called arthuna banswara district medieval temple shaiv and jain influences was the capital city utthana amravati the parmar rulers 11th century took back time really nestled very ordinary looking typical indian town not very magnificent but mesmerizing for sure not single temple but collection temples build successive rulers parmar dynasty central india with ancient medieval names like chamundaraja mandalesa etc the back the compund there this beautiful lake and raised temple overlooking the lake and lush greens plain around maybe the king used bath there and the temple stairs his morning temple pooja don know for sure but once place like this you travel back time and vivid imagination takes hold your mind and that was the best part about was really nice surprise find place like this rajasthan which has mostly late medieval heritage sites the small hidden gems like these which are hidden under plainsight that can give you unexpected pleasure ,1

 don know modi has direct hand this not but his ministers and party members along with many saffron gangs absolutely does have doubt about very cunningly never acts against admonishes right wing loonies inside the bjp like muzaffarnagar rioters giriraj singh adityanath etc instead rewards them with cabinet positions follows similar pattern for the nationalism charade well these are the signs dictatorship not democracy past behavior the best predictor future behavior gujarat left stone unturned create personality cult revolving around him wants have the same cult national level encouraging people like arnab goswami who build this image further and further even enlisted mukesh ambani say something the lines not intellectual patriot you think this attitude will bite bjp 2019 hope the election will teach the bjp lesson ,1

 was not like this nda saffronisation educational institutions was done that time well general sense the nda was more open opposition and abv personally listened and answered many his govt criticism unfortunately this not the case this govt their major effort goes belittling the opposing voices and they cannot ignored immediately branded into anti national patriotic because the majority they are under the impression that whatever they right and one can question them specially the opposition since all them got divided votes firmly believe that are the starting phases fascism and moving towards dictatorship all the signs are there party can associate itself with nationalism and then move forward with that approach then you have effectively annihilated the opposition any opposing voices will considered anti national opposition the legislature the cornerstone democracy and the current opposition almost dying state,1

what people with liberal right wing attitudes fail see that there always need balance too many scams specially ones which compromised national security irked the public the last years before 2014 people were looking scams everyday when the intellectuals justified them all the time people hated intellectuals people like choose sides for long the majority felt things are going good for you only you are minorty special rights positive media coverage anything riot anytime and you are saved you are media report against national security warzone terrorist attack and show anything pass any security check threaten anyone showing your press pass hit the majority whenever you want all this built pressure leading 2014 elections win for bjp now the reverse happening people right central wing now feel the left and media trying discredit all ministers faking stuff like church attacks jnu etc they feel the urge push even more hence the amount trolling and crap given writers politicians media increases some after the disappointment with aap became even more salty all this not some explanation want give for the unruly behaviour right wing which confused about patriotism they feel slamming the other side down like they have been for past few years good thing and victory heck saw stupid watsapp video guy rejecting project for pakistan giving flimsy excuses the need balance will cause left wing strike back hard next years but not 2019 you predicted hopefully sanity will restored wit equal balance right and left ,1
there rise far right versions nationalism and patriotisms all over the world this actually far worse some countries than india look turkey russia even the rise trump every one feeling that they have been victimized whatever they consider others and they are out for blood fan modi and wont vote for him but think there more thus sudden rise extreme nationalism than modi possibly rise new media combined with old media converting into rant style breaking news delivery system partially blame imo people believe that there are simple solution all world problems and its the others whose moral corruption hindering progress they harbor lot anger and new media has given them outlet ,1

 the only one here sick all the loud open deep hypocrisy that the left wing practices each and every single time they make moral appeal like this thread yes the entirely right about the bjp exploiting nationalism and overusing jingoistic sentiments but the people who attack them for this opposition media left wing intellectuals are being deeply hypocritical and practicing open double standards because for nearly india entire independent history they have been doing the same thing suppress right wing voices india appropriating secularism and the idea india their own they are still doing this this has become common that everyone treats normal life every single election politicians and journalists keep talking how non bjp parties divide the secular vote and anyone associated with the bjp are automatically the communal forces the clear implication always that anyone voting for the bjp communal voter even means the electorate state nobody ever blinks these generalizations and labels and there are always every week anguished opinion columns and editorials journalists random fillmakers artistes intellectuals about how india values are being eroded how this country losing its idea and soul and who are you people decide what the secular vote the soul the nation the idea india all the time and while doing this you simultaneously complain about how nationalism doesn belong the bjp how about both sides stop whining about the other side exploiting national sentiments and values for politics even when they themselves ,-1

there always dichotomy yes true that nationalism getting nauseatingly strong some aspects however nationalism also unifies people from different economical and cultural backgrounds and desperately need for economic development personally feel concerned about nationalism but think that pmo has tried provide responsible and progressive leadership and has tried reign the crazies his party with some degree success will vote for bjp 2019 unless something changes for the worse ,1

 since the bjp came power 2014 nationalism and patriotism has been turned into dick measuring contest has always been probably since freedom struggle days love the nation more than you questioning the government questioning the army you you are sickular porkistani there way question army everyone questions government from congress aap intellectuals don know modi has direct hand this not but his ministers and party members along with many saffron gangs questioning him about has become anti national what that you really want you want government control random trolls the web any such rules will quickly turn against foe these are the signs dictatorship not democracy anyone except arnob paid media half rindia thinks ravish kumar some genius and arnab trolled most the web also look radia tapes edit are trying become another pakistan curbing any kind opposing speach the first sign opposition considered dissent our politics are turning into politics 1950 2000 atleast bjp turning into republican party that time ,1
bjp not nationalism don mix the two the former foreign secretary told parliamentary panel that the party was lying and that surgical strikes have taken place before forgive don fall for political traps nationalism which veer jingoism years ago bjp used religiosity and ram mandir win and now they using nationalism having said that india stage where people are uneducated that nationalism concern but also not educated that should concern you see blind nationalistic idiots mostly semi literate people ,-1
yes your feeling the fall back option self loathing indians when they can put credible argument how there anything wrong with replying with years pakistan based terrorist attacks how there anything wrong with promoting the fact that bjp actually completed election promise how the nda government responsible for cinema owners exhibitors association india decision boycotting adhm how questioning the credibility army strikes questioning the policy army strikes are the same thing how exactly things were better back 2008 how they will better arvind hardik best patriot kejriwal rule when other politicians standard patriotism low wonder people flock towards bjp unless something disastrous happens bjp will come back with greater majority 2019 funny how liberals will take comments twitter being bullied the right wing how anything goes wrong with their life people will blame modi wonder how disconnected from the rest his country filled with shame one needs reach this mindset ,1

 you find this fuckery wait see them post retirement that atleast they could enjoy the freedom flexibilities they don wake same every damn day even not feeling well sleep same 1030pm every damn night even nice movie they like turn the same three channels same five bhajans same coffee reminds that fast fwd routine scene tamasha movie parents like listening music wanted buy them good speakers gave speakers small but good them for month try before buying new better ones for them did the setup showed everything just one knob they didn even turn for full months whatsapp seems give them the kicks these days almost everyday mom talks about one other thing she saw there and half the time end explaining how that forward patently wrong nevertheless something talk for 15minutes they rant about every cousin age buying big big ipad etc for their parents their age when offer the same they refuse speakers try not tried new gas stove not even unpacked what more can just gave spending cpu cycles thinking how make them happier looks like the only next step getting married soon but not like any the profiles their astrologers approve that different rant thread stopping here ,1
 cents instead pushing them towards wholesale change lifestyle why not start slowly for example you said taken pranayam maybe get him into local yoga group motivate them exotic pilgrimage locales like kailash muktinath and they might develop affinity towards nature and they can then motivated non religious treks hopefully this also gets them widen their social circle and they motivated different things ,1
same case here bigger fear will turn out the same way ,0
wow used have exactly the same concern year ago still some extent but here are the initiatives took help parents have fun time also saw mom just roaming around the house doing errands pass time just sitting idly the balcony could relate how painfully bored she used get weekends after heavy work week one the steps took was sign her facebook best decision ever she spends least half hour every day facebook she found lot her long lost friends and stays updated with relatives next got her smartphone and got her whatsapp that too turned out well got her tablet recently because the phone was too shitty operate and whatsapp she uses the tablet for and occasionally plays games besides introducing her the digital world often take her out dinners fancy hotels malls for shopping some recreational locations etc this kind hard due time constraints but always try put family time the top priority list because nothing else more important than spending time with your family precious fleeting and often you don realize what you got until you longer have tried coaxing her into movies but she doesn seem into show her funny and interesting videos youtube introduce her different kinds music and yes take whole lot initiative from end and that only how works can never expect mom ask things want something she simple like that try give what she doesn ask for ,1
man parents are almost the same mom obsessed with and brother and has life her own what your age think have common problem and can work together towards solving ,-1
 the discussion threads you been posting are interesting they are like getting the pulse people variety topics are you gathering ideas for media marketing new products ,1
its indian parents talk they are those that will drive mountain rather than hike because they had walk lot when they were young they prefer hotels rather than camping because they had sleep outside they prefer restaurants over barbeque they had cook open fire because they dkesntr have microwaves its different generation leave them and let them happy you want something activity with them they liking for take them out and show them ,1
live and let live bro ,1
also there another perspective ponniyin selvan says here perhaps some trying see through our lens how would spend retired life when have this much money free time versus why are parents doing only these mundane stuff day after day after day show some stuff that they might find interesting forcing here just like how parents try need introduce several perspectives life avenues learning their children esp during long holiday breaks senior children want try show them more variety more interesting ways spend their time there some years time for healthy active retired life and then some more listen music really nice headphones naa ears will bad okay with old cracky speakers new types movies are releasing these days try some naa this impractical action movie that way too sad movie what this silly comedy that family movie just like our home too much love romance who does life try these books read your pace find out which genre you like what get reading their friends have moved away some them passed away known long time neighbours have moved what used calm laid back town during their young age now busy crowded noisy town not city like bengaluru they feel baffled their own place you get the idea agree they cannot accept the entire platter change their entire lifestyle routines but sad when they even refuse sample any those things try introduce and then there this thing during phone calls that aunt went foreign tour this uncle went ten day yoga camp forest their son gave big phone etc that what ticks off guess need put listen only cap and move with our busy lives ,1
parents dont drink will take them wine tasting then whine when they lose their cool typical logic smug know alls this sub reddit since you hate modi maybe they should take you his rally and see how you fare afterall its only fair that you should try something new too ,1
yeah right entitled little brat spends her day watching american sitcoms and reading reddit and going spas that wonderful enriching way live life but some year old reads toi and goes temples that insipid grind pray tell what earth shattering creative things you did with your life the recent past that gives you the pomposity severely critical them climbed mountain wrote book ,1
this seems similar was actually painful read same story here moved out almost years ago now living own mumbai thousand kilometres away visit home maybe once twice year and always makes sad same shit you whatsapp happened both parents who are very well educated doctors turned into modi bhakts and became sort bigoted dad more than mum dad has hobby though but has become too clingy keeps saying that another years and then will retire and settle with but don want his life that just seems sad want him explore india the world like used his teenage but that part him gone now mean understand its because cares for but don want him live life where waits for come back home from work and sit around home all day want him learn new stuff travel and whatnot but that part dead seems now its pretty sad and have clue how reverse this ,-1
 advice you something different from seek advise like good boss does not delegate but challenges team with task keep dad mom super busy physically and mentally discourage father from riding bike picked walking and daily walks approx dad and mom both walking for shopping movies which hardly half don force anything but rather seek their involvement was scared dad riding ,1
 father mid 50s well plays badminton everyday and recently tried his hands golf attends vipassana courses often goes out see new movie and reads books everyday and also bought him kindle recently since avid reader you should encourage your parents pick some sport read some good books spirituality biography and other kinds inspirational topics,1

the cag comment veracity lpg subsidy numbers shook they blatantly lied about something miniscule since then made rule thumb not believe any number thrown this govt their main purpose when disclosing any kind numbers seems image management same with gdp numbers and any other numbers for that matter ,1
 hard talk about modi isolation since maintains politically correct image since taking office from the actions his party nothing much has changed support for thugs the name patriotism threatening cut funds for scientific research tacit support for hindutva promoting hindi reinterpreting indian history never mind that those mughal outsiders actually led india its economic peak promoting the delusion that ancient india was scientific superpower never mind that uniting ancient india under single label itself british creation etc still healthy overall for the government change once while that the most positive thing can say ,1

too difficult summarise bound forget lot details but trying mostly the same thought would appealing the middle classes and think that correct this pretty much the lines vajpayee the few capable ministers just like then seem doing good job personally have issues with his globe trotting however don think smart thought was previously had suspected that has better political brain that any other politician india either was wrong then governing india with all its pressures and balancing his own priorities with that his party rss the vote bank has proven bit too tough for him not going into specifics here but the impression have that each time think doing good job something immediately follows blunder something else that puts back square not judging his pak and kashmir policy not know what the policy judge maybe there policy but not what are told the bombast and not the policy though many his supporters and opponents think but there possibilty that just muddling along here and there really policy all the rise extreme nationalism the beef issue are all nothing new and expected from bjp government was all the same with vajpayee too has opinion changed hmm well modi does not feel dangerous felt then but then that might mean smarter than think and can see what plotting which actually may mean more dangerous than think ,1
thank you you deplorable autists for finding all this out and making these memes spreading them all over twitter raise awareness need bring this shit down flames and save these kids clintons are gonna pay big time because god himself doubt angered them yall are seriously doing the lord work the bible says those who cause little ones sin would better off thrown into the sea stone tied around their necks the ocean ready accept these clinton soros epstein and whatever else bitchss ,-1
 difficult make out where the fluff ends and reality begins there just much marketing having said that has certainly taken few good initiatives unfortunately will take someone with microscope and months free time correctly analyze his claims major annoyance his inability take criticism and general heavy handedness against his opposition anyone daring raise voice against his shut down vehemently which not good for indian democracy ,-1
his speech giving still still promises the moon but three years the delivery missing was hoping would more anti corruption and less right wing far has been polarising leader who crushing dissent with iron hand and doesn seem have vision policy and economy punjab and will decide see more mellow and humble modi more the conceited intolerant pride thats become his hallmark ,1
 sure matter what peoples opinions are everyone loved him the day the surgical strikes that was kick ass ,1
 mid 2013 for few days had actually dabbled with the thought voting for modi the lok sabha elections didn expect much from him but had hoped that would least more right wing economic non religion related policies than congress however quickly decided not because stuff other than the economy there were too many deal breakers sadly disappointed even that one thing ended same congress economic policies and has shown that big believer big government big governance some might even say worse than congress ,1
modi has disappointed quite bit four major reasons with some overlapping features general buffoonery the slapping sedition charges everyone the banning news organizations calling research paper pollution unscientific and political wanting send everyone pakistan etc his choice ministers some them like javadekar and mahesh sharma are easily among the worst seen the last years javadekar specially when was environment minister was far the most cartoonishly evil minister seen others like parrikar are idiots who concentrate aamir khan statements over far more important events defence minister his followers nationalism religious fervour and occasionally war happy attitudes not surprised see the kashmir and dalit riots happen under this government pains see the level blind jingoism which expected everyone the country was however horrified see peace deal between goon thackeray and filmmaker brokered who proud would tolerable the economic policy aspects the government were great but they not despite favourable features like the cheap petrol available technology being more accessible than ever solar energy etc short his govt comes across great marketers for example the use the term surgical strike modi speeches but there not much substance behind the words ,1
modi india the rich get richer the poor get subsidies and the middle class gets big bharat mata jai their asses you want you like you get ,-1

 proud modi but coming out with the news surgical strike like macho man was very wrong decision risked the lives lot people civilians which live border areas are worse hit recently family people died and one year old was badly injured army personnel were also martyred mean they attacked you conducted surgical strike the message was conveyed why come out all macho ,-1
 didn give shit back then don give shit now ,-1
one thing noticed here too that people expect way too much from political leader the short time she comes power one must understand that political party has integrity most what put the manifesto takes good amount time definitely years show results what should either force these guys not put such stuff shut our mouths about non performance neither modi nor manmohan anyone for that matter even close people like lee kuan yew when comes being badass and putting national interests above everything else everyone out there needs politics survive bjp does not play cow politics not gonna win single seat the hindi belt congress does not play appeasement politics seats for them either only when the middle class becomes the majority will politics get cleaner ,1
 hope not too heavy the hindutva agenda needs openly denounce these moral guardian goons and curb rss influence they better not flourish riding modi back ,1
honestly more than disappointed some extent even had bought the gujarat model nothing thought had vision for india and seemed like from his speeches right now seems going nowhere has absolutely idea where wants see india another years and what wants job creations have gone down make india was flop but that wouldn have worked anyway hard separate the advertisement from reality needs get his shit back together has worked enough foreign policy and needs focus more internal affairs not hard stand for the minorities once while will help doesn try put his stooges all government positions people here will say that doesn need comment trivial issues but had all the time the world comment small issues when politically benefitted him ,1

 would like add few points would much venture and say the media had studied indian media 2014 they would have learnt lot lessons before the elections don belittle the opposition and anybody who has opposing view point the left liberal narrative india was and rss agent out kill muslims and slay the christian infidel you can see echoes this this day where the 2014 elections are derided victory for communal forces though the 150 million votes who voted nda are all bloodthirsty bigots accept the opposing view point give them listen understand what they want what they aspire what drives them vote for the candidate they want vote for not dismiss out hand then prevents you from formulating appropriate response the people not vote some esoteric principles they vote for access roti kapada aur pani leave alone makaan you can talk yourselves blue the face some ndtv discussion your studio about the principles the idea india the fact remains the majority vote because they want see person given them full belly some clean water drink and some decent clothes wear you can give this them they will vote you out the upa misread this entirely and utterly did the nda the indian media continues misread esp the left liberals the country they don care what happens some jnu president they care about themselves and their families finito even here not enough that understand the person the average voter wants but the motives that drive the person chose the leader crucial understand the electorate you are longer the only media source out there even years ago the media houses wrote the news scripted agendas and created narratives today world shitty forward from your next door unkil has more currency for the average citizen than some amazing passionate well written oped amartya sen aravind panagriya sad but the truth this can cut both ways can force good you can easily rile large sections the populace with well timed well crafted shitty whatsapp tweet either ways the fact remains that news media has competition and crowd sourced high time they woke which brings subpoint allow opposing view point primetime media starting 2012 all the media houses bar none till times now shifted towards modi midway into the 2014 campaign followed the exact same homogenous template which resulted the exact same things being said modi won even nominated will moderate now that modi nominated will hung parliament needing regional politicians seats hence modi will replaced now that modi has won and here the pendulum swung the other extreme will create this super small cabinet plutocrats and forth point 100 the mainstream english media said the exact same things resulting homogenity news that drowned out anything that the real world was feeding back them these are all the exact same mistakes the media and liberal establishment made with trump not case the indian media and liberal establishment learning from 2016 but the media and liberals should have learnt from india 2014 ,1

 not able find the show youtube but 10th cnn news ran minute segment where the msm went wrong one economist the panel said that the world changed after 2008 and now there are less people who are getting the better end globalisation and thus analysts and economists who tries get which way people would move need change their methods with better fine tuning suit the current world one former indian diplomat suggested that journalists need back methods reporting news instead what they today where they are passing judgements the news let people form their judgement not impose this them this also good video trump victory xvxqu0tgavk but from cnn bit left leaning ,1

 saying pretty much what everyone said about the outcome and tbh isn wrong the more people point out the better this what said right after the election and what means for indians this brexit the silent majority who mainstream media said didn exist have spoken the entire establishment media celebrities etc was against this guy yet won the urban citizens the live bubble they are entirely disconnected from the rest the country and the rural parts and polls are completely unreliable for indians need understand this same disconnect exists here and much much bigger difference than urban indians care believe the congress like the democratic party the right now elitist nepotistic and incompetent healthy democracy always needs strong opposition the bjp apart from those the top has lot rotten apples the congress gets weaker and weaker the rotten apples within the bjp will increase all honesty hope the congress gets more competent leaders and able make comeback sometime the future for india relations with the let see what happens the entire world entering uncharted waters and looks uncertain ever for indian media arnab k2nuaijtkma said are more concerned about the world than what happens india that sad reality bomb explosion naxalite area doesn concern much don run change our share our grievances but explosion western country gets all riled now don get wrong both are horrible acts but ourselves are selective when comes showing support grief when someone complains that the west doesn care about terrorist attacks third world countries how and why should they care much when ourselves don seem care about the reality around don expect them today all media propaganda all the best way keep yourself informed listen all the biases and come conclusion yourself heck news had more unbiased coverage the elections than western media and when media house that international standards launched india shouldn limit itself just news quality documentaries should also part sad that western media able make better documentaries about india than but for all this happen the people india and especially the urban people need more concerned about domestic issues about rural issues show you grim picture but that the reality shutting yourself from that and showing concern about the flint water crisis california drought just hypocritical for indians the west indians wanting move the west indians cover all spectrums employment the west from engineers blue collar jobs nasa and other tech companies have many indian americans not necessarily indians from india not saying there aren any indians these companies but the indians see are mostly indian americans and those h1b are primarily hired work for less pay the h1b visas which indians get the lion share being heavily misused they started outsourcing white collar jobs immigrants who were ready work for less pay they already did this with blue collar jobs and been disaster the middle class american all this frustration and lot other reasons what led trump wouldn surprised there heavy curb h1b from now the last few years there been increase indians who come study western countries and then end doing blue collar jobs even after graduation this has been the norm australia for years now seen plenty indians come and study degree that both the university and students know useless and the real motive get and work driving taxis gas station now working while studying great and wonderful way survive your own and learn some humility but they continue work for less pay even after graduation which the real problem the recent elections also message the rest the world fix and build their own countries and stop running america west make your living and about the ceos google microsoft course these are competent people but wouldn rule out they were given the position because they were indians google and microsoft both want capture the growing indian market what better way start that than appointing indian the ceo edit formatting ,1

 banerjee currently researching the effects low protein diets placental phenotypes and the potential for maternal metabolic adaptations lessen these effects curious about the tissue section figure you describe your methods that you collected the chorio decidual membrane labelled the figure the chorion and amnion understanding the decidua overlays the placental tissue junctional zone parietal tgc e14 wondering the sections shown figure are showing the decidual layer that overlays the placenta adjacent layer the yolk sac closely associated with the chorion shown figure this just clarify understanding the figure was also wondering you have considered that the from your gbs strain could exert cytotoxic effects during chorio alantoic attachment are you looking effects this attachment future aim would you consider the effects exerted only the mature amnion hope this makes sense and thank you for doing this ama ,0

sorry but your conclusions drawn from the data you presented are terrible for all those people calling modi murderer apparently there statistically lower chance you dying bank line than pretty much anywhere else india bank lines make safer for you reach this conclusion you need divide average number people bank line any given point time and 000 india population average number people bank like any given point time however even that conclusion doesn logically prove that the deaths were due demonetization otherwise logically prove you have figure out how many those fifty five people would have been alive had they not been standing the line bank with the stress brought about demonetization secondly you also need compute how many people standing the lines would have been dead had they not been standing those lines total dead total saved government has negative karma and the number then positive karma since practically impossible get the two numbers can assume that there simple way make back the envelope calculations and decide one way other however the way you took try and prove whatever you were trying was frankly atrocious that because unless single cause death causes more than deaths would unimportant and safer than normal according your logic ,-1

let assume crore people visited the bank queues probability death per crore assuming each person spent hours the queue the probability someone dying the same time not for the queue 1000 deaths hour 3000 125 crore now you need factor few things nobody with serious medical condition respiratory stroke diarrhea etc which would result about conservative estimate the deaths the queue can safely cut the estimate down 750 deaths for fair comparison the cumulative mortality rate for indians less than year old times higher than the average population considering they make third the population that readjusts the deaths estimate half but since kids are more susceptible some the previously mentioned conditions will readjust 400 already the comparable figures become demonetization otherwise still haven accounted for impact senior citizens and hours average lot real value will probably much lower but highly skewed with most people getting done hour but others coming back for days you can also increase the number visitors required once all that considered you come realize that even mathematically demonetization has non negligible impact this right here the epitome insensitivity when comes the demonetization scheme your logic even serving the army safer than sitting home 155 out 000 security personnel army and police died last year due terrorism violence normal death rate was that two orders magnitude safer being the army police sources age specific death rates sex pdf htm,1

visionary indeed imagine trades worth our economy being carried out single online marketplace next logical step take steps make internet cheaper faster for everyone digital india not possible with costly yet slow internet ,1
this really good next need make civil work open and online too the price timeframe guarantee and this should transparently available online ,1
 guess how works make all vendors list their products the website including the quote support price and life time cost choose the lowest cost from list items for the government hospital chitoor wants buy needles they can this portal and purchase the lowest cost one some questions remains but think wonderful idea whoever thought this real innovator ,1
good initiative see lots challenges the beginning terms boarding the vendors and training the employees but this step the right direction bring transparency for this scale trade that the govt indulges ,1
revolutionary stuff ,0
 not know about other countries but singapore follows similar system for government bids wife worked this project until recently every bid step can traced making the process quite transparent ,-1
this why modi the you can fault him for implementation but least thinking the right way india going become digital cashless society within reasonable timeframe but just because can done overnight doesn mean that there shouldn rapid progress india lot bureaucracy like all countries moves very slowly needs someone the top who keeps pushing progress can someone imagine raga doing this until and unless the opposition gets their act together and nominates future oriented dynamic leader don see anything but secure election 2019 for him ,1
great move right now only those with connections gets the contracts based internet reading first hand knowledge hopefully this will give chance for newbie with better and cheaper product and hopefully digital trace would followed unearth unnecessary spending,1

best tip can give anyone with solid but predictable language would imagine actually functioning with people culture etc are they isolated from other language families maybe they have their 100 germanic language and one day they are introduced japanese something and they take the things they like and try and mash them together maybe they develop writing system that only works for one their accents and the same symbol represents several sounds depending where you are stuff like this not only can help you spice your language terms sound word structure but also any rules you have will end with exceptions you might end with synonyms and homophones and those are very naturalistic things ,1
anyone else find this creepy fuck always reminds this jpg ,-1
this why this guy will win the next election too knows that politics optics and substance doesn matter demonetisation will destroy casual informal labour and crush economic activity for the poor long can spin necessary pain kill corruption let ignore the fact that only black money even cash begin with the people will lap goes funeral let make sure photographed everywhere everything becomes photo the campaign permanent even though fan democracy can understand why there have been serious arguments against since the system tends promote the most venal narcissistic people into power who are the best exploiting mass media create image people are not really into facts and figures and economists bores them ,1

sorry but the glf and demonetisation cannot any way not even remotely compared the very act banning private holding land that decimated the peasants for decades pushing them communes thereby destroying year way life and causing mega fucking famine that killed million chinese one point the death rate was more than the birth rate not any way shape form comparable demonetisation secondly the communist party held control all levers power and propganda and mao was pretty much impossible criticise open any newspaper news channel online media and you will see pages and pages hours and hours criticism this move please don use hyperbole much that your ideas can taken seriously ,-1

edit this was first time expressing political view reddit should all try understand the point view the other side without animosity you can keep calling modi fenku but honestly doubt that modi cares much whether you call him fenku jhantu gandu don have keep talking about the problems our country faces guys can also part the solution here pull off trump card soldier soldier bol dia koi argument bacha nahi much hate the discomfort that this demonetization has caused think should still let bjp run the country really believe that they need more time and people need more time assess their leaders bold steps might bad like this demonetization one but bold steps are necessary for any significant change the country the propaganda around modi ridiculous but what are the alternatives are probably more informed than people living the villages and should use choose lesser the two evils also think that our media has blown things out proportion many instances love have some bold steps taken make sure that the fourth pillar democracy remains impartial criticizing government important but sensationalizing everything only going make things more and more difficult and please avoid using the bhakt title for anybody who thinks modi apt for the country this moment mud slinging only going take all further away from the opposite point view ,1
 either way fucked agree ,-1
 2019 demonetization will history people usually easily forget everything next year bjp should start massive infrastructure development rural areas schools roads toilets village center dams and water pipeline warehouse etc years the effect will visible the villagers see money coming from construction work and life improving then they will definitely vote the way the center just got huge amount cash from people demonetization one year before election there should some corruption scandal involving congress and regional parties media will make them look like thugs corruption news are sold better than riots and gets sensationalized quickly bjp can come power easily rahul gandhi will make congress party monkeys true definition congress ,1
 indian media has been too kind modi dude what the fuck are you talking about doordashan ,1
just like mao think modi also oblivious the large scale suffering that this move has caused loss jobs loss productivity decrease demand etc has surrounded himself with many yes men that impossible know whether knows about the tragedy that has occurred result his actions however the changing narrative the government and shifting the blame does indicate that modi gradually realizing the futility the demonetization exercise ,1
thanks for your view points remember article how govt china makes the shopkeepers mandatory dispense out lottery tickets issued govt that they can keep track transactions stop tax evasion businesses think universal that people hate pay taxes and the same time hold sense entitlement when comes receiving services from govt understand the discussion little more 500 1000 notes constitute the currency true however how much stored used day day result this situation like this money does not get transacted taxes collected are lower that fine government can keep printing notes this what exactly happened earlier via mnrega and other welfare schemes only creates situation later when large amounts money floods market product inflation will raise this can observed items that people who have hoarded wish buy one cannot buy more perishable goods than required inflation these items not considerable this can also change when cold storage become more prevalent let say onion market onions can hoarded with hoarded money depriving taxes government not registering the transaction you can rig the price what done here not paying taxes you have additional money which goes onto create inflation while govt unaware unaware has record cornering market known problem indirect tax has important function helps determine price market the transactions are not recorded breaks the price discovery while can say market economy should correct this there real free market the world except econ 101 this would not problem currency had expiry date does now are here and now while you can talk world will end won because human tendency work for any compensation the labor rate falls tomorrow there still supply soon the real value labor will discovered ,1

you are not entirely wrong far the analogy goes the comparison demonetization with mao campaign appropriate spirit old kind politics the one many thought had become unfashionable after reforms and subsequent liberalization has returned this the politics hammering the economy without worrying about subtle and indirect impacts accompanied with the rhetoric moral victory and sacrifices politics first subordinated institution and now has again managed subordinate the economy one abrupt act the government has managed hit the livelihood millions and this comes from party which promised less government seems that they didn understand their own message tempting conclude that demonetization was one off decision bad this mistake will not repeated hard agree with this conclusion once the beast out cage there stopping and politicians very often become captive their own rhetoric ,1
modi has shifted his focus from anti corruption since this move backfired bad within few weeks deployment and bjp are now big time promoting cashless move see this campaign everywhere from radios internet the end the month people will believe modi never made this demonetization move control black money and corruption but promote cashless economy which infact did gather support for upcoming state elections ,-1
just last months have had uri attack then boycott china demonetisation black money demon cashless india and now will whatever finally whatever year won remember anything though this might take bit longer randi rona lasts more than couple months india only constants our life are soldiers and 6lpm ,1
 appreciate your thoughts outsider here but disagree with you what weak analogy sure there something like personality cult however democratic set ups any set really leadership some level about creating followership disagreement with your analysis the lack criticism and the steel demonetization bit india has lot built criticism mechanisms not like the chinese controlled system not yet but much closer that than chinese system look any indian newspaper and you will see starting diy steel manufacturing very different than money supply issue the whole thing will settle down couple more months may another year tops steel competes with global steel there competition inr india again not saying that this could not disastrous but the mao glf simile stretch the least ,1
great leap forward really chinese dude maybe you don understand but india real democracy and modi policy are even remotely disastrous glp the parliament would dissolved and mass protests would break out every major city nda cannot hold power without the people support please bullshit someone else ,1
right called national parties can run roughshod over democracy with nary care for federalism human economic linguistic rights people and you have the gall call coalition powers rag tag bunch the self righteousness this too damn high ,1
 the other hand demonitization and follow measures succeed can look forward increasingly aggressive nationalism bhaktification and gradual silencing all dissent forget all that see increasingly shitty aggressive moves that are all optics the cost fucking over the economy ,-1
 demonetization fails they will start playing mandir politics bjp not going out power there virtually opposition ,-1
hey man the demonetisation knocked few points off the gdp growth rate and there some temporary suffering rural india which reducing the day not modi supporter who supports everything does even though feel the implementation could have been better differently believe this positive step this needs followed with more actions tackle corruption actually the great leap forward was totally different scale and the social engineering that was being done the commies was vastly more dangerous cannot really compared with this demonetization plan which pretty much winding down these days also you right saying that the rich people are going find loopholes but believe this action nets about the rich people who stow away cash follow they should digitize land records and rationalize gold and shares held stock market too these are the primary places where black money stowed away ,1
frankly you are missing the point ridding the economy physical cash all about getting the money into bank accounts physical cash money issued directly the central bank bank account money derivative money multiple getting people hold savings banks gives banks power leverage those savings and create more money for themselves happening now everywhere the planet because the banking system highly coordinated also why the indian government soft banning gold gold real money and outside the banking system the global bank cartel has already created far more debt than can paid back the currencies have today value real terms two things will happen currency will radically devalued even usd eventually and every scrap real economy must brought into the banks india going through the same everyone popular powerful leader borrow spend tax leverage all the benefit the money cartel the stock and flow physical notes does not aid the banks bank accounts ,1
one major point disconnect mao didn have back the people months after executed the great leap forward modi wants elected this move disastrous his critics are arguing they should secretly happy right months not enough time for the public forget how many their relatives lost their lives standing queues just clear and how all the black money holders they the common public have not suffered any material loss was huge supporter this move when announced still about favour the action agreed that there going quarters depressed growth agreed that probably most the has been laundered the move still makes sense can set out the reasons another post democracy enjoys public trust his actions will have consequences may 2019 will show whether squandered the trust enjoys that trust affirmed ,1
bhai mere demonetization has already failed only the government insists beating the dead dog high denom money likely deposited back into the system showing how the whole black money objective was badly missed top that the severe hit the informal economy will shrink our gdp well this miserably failed scheme ever there was one but thats what you get when you have trp based governance ,-1

the thing atleast the govt doing something against demonetisation and think the plan might fail but atleast its still plan some plans will work out some will disastrous the river project have had decades indecisiveness and lack direction even china had declared that prc will only deal settle border disputes with decisive majority govt and this the first such govt since 1984 after 30years ,-1
 just shocked that the prime minister had much power that can void the country currency with announcement they wanted strongman they got strong man now they are the ones who have strong really they have excuse they deserve this state affairs ,1
 demonitization fails incorrect not question fails has already happened there are benefits and massive pain the bjp will lose badly 2019 will never happen even with the evident demonetisation failure the next election long years away people mostly vote the last year maybe even half year 2018 these effects will gone modi natural political talent will supersede any attempt the feckless opposition mount counter attack the fundamental problem for the opposition has not changed they have not single person who even remotely skilled modi namo understands that politics optics nobody knows the details demonetisation fails can just spin the evil black money masters doing their evil work people should patient the struggle long people will lap can look forward increasingly aggressive nationalism bhaktification and gradual silencing all dissent that will depends the margin victory 2019 expect come down the bjp may also need more heavily use coalitions and either expand the nda tactical voting with neutral parties that would put natural dampener the crazies ,-1
 never got how anyone can believe replacing bank notes will fix any the problems modi promised fix corruption fake money terrorism etc own country much more less cash compared india yet corrupt fuck has its own fake money problems massive shadow banking sector and plenty terrorism logic maybe get that the point black money can argued both ways but say that hasnt helped with counterfeit just stupidity flushed out lot counterfeit currency,-1

this man giving everyone willing pay attention masterclass public relations you say you will take the blame fails but the same time you never admit fails then you never have take the blame either you get the political benefit admitting blame without actually binding yourself any commitment recognising failure gives ample room spin any failure forces out your control and such you can skip any accountability suits you the meantime you get all the goodwill from the na√Øve this guy should write book after retires amazing really mean that ,-1

 actually think modi doing good job about demonetization itself think the benefits that already see the roots outweigh the cons maybe biased this diagnosis disclaimer could possibly stand gain from the cashless transactions push work fintech but then one side see jokers like trump america buffoons like park geun hye impeached today south korea cheats like dilma rousseff also impeached brazil now compare the seemingly good leaders obama putin debatable but consider him very much one shinzo abe angela merkel etc and definitely think modi able stand amongst them rather than the previous sorry lot nor the big camp that doesn really much consider these guy just bad camp the effects demonetisation won even know all 2019 but how feel rather have ballsy leader that atleast tries something rather than sits his ass with one hand his butt and the other down his her throat even fail badly this there are still many good side effects from actually undertaking such experiment and yes saying country are too big fail would really stupid yet find there are already multiple checks being put place improve the situation and cushion the longer term problems and country are really patient that good thing how would know yet find approve his style may may not agree with modinomics but can only agree with the fact that atleast did try bring some serious changes instead burying his head the sand like mms did and what are our other options pappu kejriwal mulayam mamata jayalalitha rip better amongst these evils the very least for now its lot harder for the like wow that feels odd understand the plight the common man don have wife kids take care can buy stuff want from amazon now get free food from office buy everything else require from the supermarket saturday sunday and buy coupons use sodexo etc from the local kirana for daily stuff like milk biscuits etc can claim understand the struggle the common man won find that life isn that much impacted can most stuff just fine just that have plan out things bit better which imho really good thing plus have admit namo marketting genius knows perfectly how sell his idea charismatic and makes perfect use buzz words exaggerated promises and his own style and flair that makes you want jump his hype train compare this mms who probably wasn corrupt but did close nothing and spoke the public like once year something maybe during independance day republic day mean modi said something like may the force with you something like that times square may off but thats what heard thats bloody brilliant ,1

rupee notes had been printed india‚Äô 200 000 cash dispensers could not handle the new smaller notes and would take weeks reconfigure them filling atms with the trillion rupees billion new banknotes

 think need not wait till 2019 once bjp loses 2017 terribly its mandate finished then modi will drag till 2019 without doing much then upa will come power where congress cedes some more ground regional parties but will still the biggest party the coalition ,-1
 was made young experts data and financial analysis some ran modi‚Äô social media accounts and smartphone app that used solicit public feedback our biggest fears have been proven true \ ,1
 true leader ,1
 conflicted about how feel about this guy other national leader memory has even tried act earnest him like when all you know are shitty girlfriends and then nice one just drops you just not used being treated well feels weird man real weird ,-1
wait really thinks has not failed just trying mask the failure ,1
poor people justice boner still half can still see they hope rich people will suddenly poor and playing field will levelled but what have got crores and crores new notes found from black money hoarders how have they got debatable now that crores new notes were banks and atms and not safes bathrooms hvfcayqcxsscph048shram html the lines would have disappeared now and what the fuck with the banks applying their own 10k limit daily was changed 24k weekly daily but still banks have cash honor that 24k daily and rbi still claiming that banks have got cash modi still chest thumping about his masterstroke rallies like jesus mate how the fuck are you calling for smartphone with internet enabled when only india have got internet and even lesser have any knowledge and access infra for going cashless ignorant this guy has ,-1
 tiss citizen what that sound citizen think that was our bubble ,1
 still think the right intent there but for the implementation succeed you need the right team with right skills and this where think modi should understand his limitations and beyond his team but sadly that not happening may because has very low trust quotient most authoritative rulers have very low trust quotient add that weak opposition which would cause lot complacency and think that what has happened tldr right intent but less skills know all attitude complacency,1
 stophboy7 and everybody else thank you much for your hard work not threatening enough assassinated but will honour die for this cause ,-1
why doesnt govt introduce schemes like give information and rewarded the raids themselves may fake raids click baits wherein govt itself plants fake hoarders order catch real ones,-1
 think this post another aap propaganda post showing modi bad light who said demonetization failing ,-1
first thing supported was the surgical strikes but then bjp started openly milking for political gains and started becoming suspicious that this not new and the only difference this time chest thumping then nov 8th was pleasantly surprised that actually going after black money but then the days passed learned how this foolish plan that cannot achieve the stated objectives and that too lacked any kind preperation planning and foresight the worst thing about modi thinks indians are idiots and believes that can shamelessly get away with any kind ridiculous lies ,-1
one simple explanation probably arrogance sometimes power gets into your head and you start rationalizing dumb decisions same thing happened congress leaders their second term ,-1
 fair give modi more chances his intentions seem right demonization was never easy thing and not that have landed crisis hope modi brings more stronger steps like crackdown real estate full support modi continues these issues and not even bhakt ,1
 own confession rant goes here read your own expense for army surgical strike was the tipping point modi did took decision and popularized army have been doing such ops for long before but never advertise them because backlash was proud that something has been done although his fans spoiled crowning the day namo shaurya diwas and too many whatsapp forwards but decided vote bjp that day now comes demonetization was skeptical this from the day one but what the hell old notes will exchanged and new notes will come big deal modi will get some credit for doing something about but even after days still respite for common people and paisa netas are having 20lacs new notes the dangerous unpreparedness and short sighting before tinkering with already weak economy really criminal view and for what just get few votes this asshole have destroyed many lives ,1
the scope and graveness the mandate doesn allow for such lapses was dangerously reckless decision which doesn bode well for the remaining tenure too too have lost all faith the worst people are still gung about modi and basically invulnerable this point ,-1
 couple days back read news report where the rbi said they gave back lakh crores cash new currency including hundred and other notes are they lying ,1
 preaching for ewallets when nearly 300 million ppl india have access electricity link ,1
 very very sad because modi has zero competition for 2019 good that are parliamentary democracy then don vote for president vote for mps and next years shakes faith voters will have another coalition government ,1
dear felt the same but here truth rbi did printed money but corrupt bank officials have found ways convert this money via fake accounts ,-1
serves you right for suspending your common sense post demonetisation ,-1
 the same boat you never liked modi but just post demonetisation was kinda happy thinking this might actually lead real change but after the banks started opening and some more data started flowing lost the original justice boner now say more ambivalent wait and watch kind situation leaning towards being cynical the move edit spelling misplace edit,1
cheer modi comes out with another masterstroke demonetisation drags his blind supporters might actually turn him doesn people won suffer even more ,0
since you mention the economist would like quote them from one their article politicians words particular change world and donald trump does not choose his politicians like promise action not words but this odd when was the last time political leader did anything important with physical action this was that action which politician were elected but the poor implementation and clear road map seems like they better only talk atleast gives sense that they act rather than acting like this where many suffer rbi doesn have enough space their press conf room for the economist and bbc staff per rbi they wanted have greater interaction with people present the conf room can blame them working smaller teams now what govt rbi the same thing now does ,1
 always liked modi better modi policies for the lack any better alternatives but understand that completely normal and natural that others might not like him his policies however cannot understand how someone can think him malicious surely even you disagree with his policy point view you have give him the credibility that doing everything the best interest nation from his standpoint has dynasty grow other apparent vested interests would happy have serious the point and kind answers ,1
you are correct there real opposition india right now congress joke any hope kindred the last time aap long lost but 2019 years away you can start building competition for modi 2019 bjp runs purely both urban and rural areas while might hard reach out the rural populace can least influence the netizans india shy away from any kind blind support towards anyone sincerely think doable the time campaign for 2019 starts find the right group people back think can find such group people just yesterday came know about the pirates india which sound interesting but that just first impression heck mere formal education might basic stuff like should vote for certain bad candidate just because from party should trust news etc,1
 support this move sort there are steps incoming make possible bank digitally even for the unlettered the initial crunch was necessary the cash would arrive well time replace existing stashes most existing business relationships the far out places have already managed adjust against books and trust middlemen networks have been crippled large extent then there are the queues the beginning lot them were paid cash mules all said and done takes courage what did that being said was digital for along time and hated having deal with the constant overhead finding change and result haven had stand many queues the others however isn woo woo crippling the built impressions are you would have seen crap the streets already the effects the secondary housing market have been devastating and ive seen some people crippled because they decided was worth their trouble convert their hard earned white into black complete deal they got the bamboo like have been saying here will continue watch this situation phase with analytics just kicking core banking awesome thing the data understand isn real time nevertheless financial intelligence units very likely already have good sense the incoming data the expectation that there will last minute push december that will provide huge amounts clear data that will validate many the models probably testing would assume they are clustering this data region zone light the outliers like christmas trees these will easy pickings based bank data test raids are already happening phase where feel the meat likely correlation with ground assets and identifying massive gaps again outliers will lit like christmas trees drive porsche cayenne but have return lacs have house tony neighbourhood and file return for lacs vacations spain every year all the znmd yolo life photos are likely already scraped data likely begging read this analytics wet dream layer all that with aadhar and data interception engine that has been place for the last couple years and lot indians are currently open books even they don know things are going get tighter even for business the exercise has generated enough data for many years worth enforcement and recovery ,1
 cheer guys say something positive guess the best can come with that all the stars align this will end sooner than people think india own printing capacity currency quite low will take until spring you only use the presses the country the government hasn said anything about this but assume they also get help from abroad then this could end late january especially since you may not need replenish all cash that was the system since portion was black even most the black money has been laundered however this critically hinges them swallowing their pride and doing what best for the country they are too stubborn ask for help from the outside worse are too ignorant incompetent then will months and months this nevertheless must assume for own sanity that they did ask for help from foreign countries printing currency ,1
most notable was the omission media the babri masjid anniversary dec 6th everything about demonetisation ,1
 the cabinet ministers treat the journalists like joke whenever asked about this right our dear can make joke out any question asked journalists ,1
 voted for him but have been skeptical saw through swachh bharat bull shit day one demonetization was one scheme his which thought was going work and well planned unfortunately was just another jumla now opinion his that wants good but has surrounded himself idiots because full his own awesomeness good luck him not like there any good alternative next election voting ideal candidate some jansatta type guy independent even going get only one vote ,1
 similar boat but never back anything politicians with full faith even those support was cautiously optimistic especially when heard all the stories black money hoarders getting panicky and losing all their hard earned money because they wanted keep off the books now family fine but parents and siblings and cousins haven paid their maids people who work for them ironing etc they stopped making small purchases any sort they cut back one two planned tourist trips the next month this not say they suffering directly but all the people who depend the money that relatively well off people like them spend are they donated from their stocks daal wheat and rice maids they buy from higher end supermarkets with debit card and distribute all this while hundreds crores new cash has been seized from people don know how much has gone missing this link shows that nearly 3000 atms tested over states aren working this one month now chaos and trouble this will show quarterly results soon and will hard top this the rbi has been behaving badly banning the economist and ani news from their press conferences which worrying even take the supposed good intentions demonetisation face value this turning out textbook example what the road hell paved with ,1
here comment immediately after demonitization context still holds true this day ,1
 very very sad because modi has zero competition for 2019 there more twitter bots are being increasingly used influence public thought the recent election proves that works too bjp spends thousands crores social media campaigns seen even educated people believe any political shit they see their whatsapp messages sad situation ,-1

 very very sad because modi has zero competition for 2019 the undisputed king what india needs really badly right now genuine and sincere leader someone like indira gandhi lal bahadur shastri even rajiv gandhi better than the present leadership the governance congress generally better least was until sonia gandhi and mms happened its pity that rahul gandhi didn turn out like rajiv indira and even bigger pity that they are not even considering bring someone outside the family leader even bigger question that should ask ourselves why are not getting such good and sincere leaders the present times the answer that the entire political system career that considered dirty and filthy the average citizens like but what forget whilst proclaiming this that this dirt ultimately affects and belongs sooner later someone among has got clean this ,1
back 2001 you know what vajpayee was was poet his speeches inspired millions his calm and cool nature earned him respect even though fucked with kargil war and inflation was still seen undisputed contender for 2004 elections mainly due the fact that congress was facing leadership crisis sonia gandhi was just seen gandhi bahu who couldn speak hindi but used read hinglish hindi written english everytime when giving speeches she was seen outsider many believed she wasn used indian culture but you know what she took that weakness her power and continued her whole campaign reading hindi speeches written english and the result was great mandate without the need for coalition govt point not lose hope till the last moment 2019 still long way ,1

yes whatever grievances have with the bjp and choice certain allies the opposition far far worse than anything these people have done aap and kejriwal turned out just incompetent they claim everyone else rahul and the inc are some the most corrupt parasitic worms the country has been plagued with they ruled for half century virtually unopposed and failed much guarantee drinking water the whole country forget electricity and education and everything else they had half century prove themselves and they failed utterly and completely pretty much every aspect mamata and trinamool are nothing more than goons that belong different era left with modi the best out the lot which isn really accomplishment ,1
for fuck sake one votes for lok sabha member not ,-1
 would vote for modi ,0
yes alternative seen far there are many others within this government who share the same honesty and passion for doing better and are better educated than him but still safer choice outside the bjp notable mention would chandrababu naidu raul gandhi could have been more serious leader working behind the scenes improving the governments where the congress already power could least learnt something has absolutely administrative experience could worked under ministry while upa was power but look how they screwing any more chances karnataka look him trying troll others day and night with his all fart shit rhetoric like live click bait article and even the congress vote banks know now kejriwal would have been more respectable had stuck just ruling one state well for few terms and then tried expand ,1
yes except demonetization which think good idea with poor implementation better than most railways are the biggest reason for ,1
hell the yes despite the fact that megalomaniac who ruthless and has some unsavory connections economically honest has proven track record development transformed gujarat honestly and doesn have allegiance anyone deeply concerned about the stupid fucking sedition law and its constant usage silence opposition but also pissed the indian liberals who constantly suck kejru and congi teat and refuse hold informed balanced discourse ,-1

 explanation the you can deposit above 5000 but you must all one not piecemeal you want deposit lac old notes though why you waited long beyond you cannot installments 000 and 000 you must deposit the lac once ,1
 first the limit only 5000 inr till the end the year for deposit this way they will manipulate the total amount money back into the system and force windfall not illegal they just will questioned why they did not deposit all single deposit for lot merchants are still accepting old notes discount carpenter near house gurgaon this discourage people from accepting old notes depositing somebody else behalf ,1
for all those paid writers and non paid writers economists and non economists bhakats and oppositions nationalists and non nationalists just keep quiet days king being over everyone can see what will going happen and then talk debate and abuse till then fight loss for common citizens all political parties assuming common people are monkeys and they can make dance their tune wait and watch till then are losers ,-1

mms having conversation bro had him for years respect him for all his qualifications and the titles held but let honest did nothing have highly educated financial ministers not all them could great progress honestly its the actions thst count and not just talking intelligently sure this made more efforts developing international relationships than mms know sound like bhakt this point don support bim blindly but definitely better than mms ,1
hell yes,0
 with his level knowledge and education would able make poignant points ironic that you should have the confidence use words that you don know the meaning and question the ability seasoned politician working for decades hold conversation with another political leader ,1
this kind elitist led the victory trump people don want intellectuals lead they wan leader whom they can look and connect with them people can connect with modi because went from nobody india can inspire lot indians and you may believe not people actually like him and what stands for for the negotiations and talks you wrote about have many ministries full educated beareaucrats whose full time job discuss and execute these types things ,1
actually most the negotiations are done bureaucrats that true any country even even law professor like obama needs massive bureaucracy weigh every word any deal the qualifications for being are not exactly technical though technical knowledge least few areas helps the biggest requirements management providing political insulation policy makers and executioners and most importantly listening the experts that where the biggest problem with modi lies has massive ego probably believes himself avatar vishnu and doesn listen experts ,1
typical elitist indian mindset forget modi mms this conception that only degrees from cambridge oxford harvard maybe even iit allow you think and talk strategic intellectual level might from 500 years ago but akbar was illiterate theory but reality was total military and administrative genius contemporaries who interacted with him describe him man considerable erudition who had gained merely observing others and introspection one them monserrate said and paraphrsase nobody who did not know him illiterate would consider him anything but and went away thinking was very learned and erudite closer our time and home indira gandhi who did not even pass college and yet was spectacularly competent when came politics even interacting and building bridges with world leaders though nixon and kissinger hated her abraham lincoln had little formal education and was entirely self taught man and famously called his own education defective even closer our time jayalalitha was what 10th pass for all her faults she was extremely erudite voracious reader had near eidetic memory and amazing recall facts and figures otoh you have your own mms who was used toy somebody with next educational qualifications like said this has nothing with modi mms but this arrogant attitude that deems anybody who does not have degree from fancy college brain dead could and people who were not only remarkably successful but would extremely smart and erudite despite even not having basic education why john glenn who died recently after such stellar career college dropout read churchill biography was aside from some brief flashes utterly shitty student and ironically for one the most powerful orators human history massive stutterer also like abe was pretty much self taught man this post seems inspired kejriwal tweets and the irony that someone who has decent academic record paper one the most brain dead asinine conniving assholes the indian political scene right now who talks shit and that something ,1
 just like make point that dropped out college and highest qualification high school still considered expert several subjects and experience field sees regularly get interviewed channels and print media written articles for several publications and acknowledged peers their equal the point not having let alone ground for judging anyone capabilities use experience always look out for people who are interested improving themselves and learning more rather than those who have impeccable credentials but are dumb can speak about the because never had conversation with him but judging from his body language you dead wrong you think not smart and that can hold his own against obama trudeau ,1
redditors whole are funny people live echo chamber made their own thoughts and whatever they want believe anyone who taking the yes nos here and projecting them how elections are gonna unravel plain silly look trump and how the opinion redditors was about him and how all media houses opinion polls exit polls were showing low chance him winning was bad anyone who was trump supporter was just afraid come out they would branded racist whatnot feel like same happening public about modi people are afraid they speak against modi bjp they will branded anti national pakistani aapiya aaptard khangresi etc they just keep their opinions now atleast public like how happened delhi elections every media house was replaying clips bjp leaders shiela dixit making fun kejriwal the narrative whole they were pushing was kejriwal just joke contender will lose seats max disregard him same was reflected opinion exit polls then results came aap made govt for days after that news channels again went offensive against aap about how people now know aap not serious and this time they will vote bjp for clear majority they got prepare get surprised all saying haven even seen this demonetization thing settle down yet and how going affect economy next two years outlook gloomy though ,-1

 how does that affect india image the world community you care more about the perception than reality itself none you gave fuck about the lack toilets and open defecation the past decade until poo the loo meme came actually tackle your point you are working under the false assumption that world leaders are the one who hold technical discussions that universities make you informed worldly matters obama struggles give speeches without teleprompter despite being professor contradicting your own idea higher education ,1
 with his level knowledge and education would able make poignant points bit elitist suggest lack education makes someone dunce vice versa for instance wharton alumnus donald trump thinks climate change chinese hoax the other hand remember rapporteurs tweeting during the climate change summit that modi was one the better informed politicians letterman was likewise complementary about modi understanding the issues the nat geo documentary the demonetization farce shows modi far from infallible but comes across well informed ,1
fuck yes till bjp has congress mukt bharat their goal they just have deliver greater than performance for them get vote ,1
 would think yes modi has been very perceptive about the concerns the younger generation has emphasized the movement towards digitalization cashless society and social media things that destroy the old know someone jugaadi network the older generation and instead make things more transparent fair and empowering average middle class ambitious tech savvy youngster the other hand has rolled back and emphasized the more worrisome aspects right wing including attacking minorities attacking women sexual moral policing lgbt attacks etc happy that the whole muslims gays feminists atheists westerners and valentine day are threat akhand aryabhumi and need eliminated rhetoric has piped down and modi has kept suppressed from top down yeah seems good candidate uptil now only reservations about him are foreign policy ucc and lack media interviews ,1
 the wouldn vote for any chut that went along with the demonetization fiasco ,0
 have noticed that they change the levels complexity and intellectual content their speech accordance with the audience for here justin trudeau speaking about quantum computing how this good example for what you were trying say trudeau just giving dumbed down explanation quantum computing general nontechnical audience ,1
definitely yes ,0
 can totally see mms having conversation about the ramifications such huge move demonetization think that why people make jokes about him didn really speak the masses sure that you can find him discussing complex economic topics length but there way that will reach the average person ,1
mitron ,0
interesting question and suprisingly think modi and obama became very good friends the last g20 summit after the photo session chinese tried converse with obama but obama fully ignored him and made bee line for modi they both hugged and started talking like good friends their friendship seemed very genuine keeping mind that both are different one tea seller and other graduate columbia and harvard ,1
mms was not the sonia gandhi was either that mms was absolutely corrupt mms was not even the alternative candidate for rahul gandhi was the public made the best bad situation will the next election too you want change give better alternative the public ,1
 think for international conferences bureaucrat appointed sherpa and they hold the actual negotiations pms and presidents come the event sign shake hands and smile for the camera ,1
 can totally see mms having conversation topkek mms mannequin challenge khatam gai kuchch bolo seriously mms was anything but orator can totally see mms having conversation about the ramifications such huge move demonetization with lets say obama obama vela that will call mms for random conversation about policy that doesn affect america rofl offence but people the west would laugh you out the polling booth you ask why xyz candidate not oxbridge ivy league your mindset the complete 180 the general view the average american brit only india have people more concerned about appearances than substance also the one hand you talk about communicating with the masses and examples this you talk about lectures harvard and university waterloo you didn watch your own youtube video did you wtf how out touch with the masses are you really can make head tail what this post about you seem complaining that modi not posh polished trudeau obama because his ghaati accent assuming this entire fucking post stinks elitism this sub modi baiting off the charts,1
before opening this thread thought this was going about how can modi talk leaders fluid english and joke laugh with them when doesn seem like that much english speaker can understand american english accents guess keep wondering then ,1

this exactly the reason have subject experts who all the background work the system had provisions that anyone and not just elites can lead governments ,1
 honestly don care much for politician education btw trudeau commentary was pretty basic introductionary description that you can riff from wikipedia obama and merkel are different league however all the education the world doesn prevent you from doing stupid shit even the smartest person has rely advisors and technocrats argue that more important trait wisdom knowing your own limits modi doesn know his own limits which see now but equally someone highly intelligent could end arrogant self congratulatory echo chamber where they don consult with anyone because they are wedded the idea their own excellence therefore looking someone education alone fairly poor indicator how someone will view your character values and wisdom matters more course intelligence still important but less for national leader than people think ,1
advisors the prime minister solo god all leaders have team hand picked advisory board help them with making tough decisions what really sets apart good leaders from great ones how they heed the advices they receive ,1
international politics not complicated you are making out gaining adequate amount knowledge these matters does not take more than few months for individual and you can bet modi has excellent team advisors help him out like ceos getting their smartest employees summarise books and reports you not need spend years and years learning the academic details strong grasp the basics enough function productively plus for all their educational qualifications the politicians you mentioned haven been strong leaders obama america highly divided and discontent merkel germany under assault from immigrants and she turning blind eye manmohan didn squat the years was given especially when was good finance minister ,1
yes unlike most vocal randians seeing that government actually trying reform tax system plus other countless initiatives and foreign policies ,1
yes you are right but does not matter much leaders nations would always prefer someone they can communicate with directly and clearly the same intellectual level and high educational standards and good exposure national politics and international diplomacy well proficiency global topics help when clinton called vajpayee during kargil there were reports that only clinton spoke and there was response from vajpayee did not get clinton accent who knows but what matters those levels the end not your own knowledge but whether you can summon the knowledge specialists for purpose and whether you truly have the power act promises you make for knowledge bureaucrats are brought for accent diplomats take over serious discussions the would revert hindi gujarati expect that perfectly fine there are translators get right for comprehension bureaucrats listen provide the answer based what they know what the wants and their answers are accepted the answer the and for modi ability act his word negotiations that not doubt far international negotiations modi with great mandate and that balances out his inability grasp complexities problem really not there modi not known tolerate dissenting opinions but what extent does absolutely refuse have bureaucrats found ways tell him that not right has removed those bureaucrats from top positions smart enough keep the unlikeable ones does get the right kind advice not these are questions which won have answer for long long time ,1
religion must fade away let make atheism famous india least make people aware make atheism option educate every single person you know there thing called atheism some urge may have flaws but least barbaric most let make atheism india great again science technology entrepreneurship should have mass following india like what religion commands wealth creation should desired trait and increase 10x the present level economy couple decades ,1

should put any issue discussed caused politicians and editors since minority community fault absolutely less likely discussed any opposition parties central govt mayawati did really think dalits she would have say something but she just wants sleep vote beds dalit muslims bjp being government afraid hindu muslim lines that they would let people burn media taboo talk about fault muslim community just remember the incident when gaurav sawant tweeted during saharanpur riots news should present both sides journalists leeches him calling him names and demanding his expulsion from job opposition vote bank policy ruling party jumla and media hypocrisy responsible ,-1
because modi bjp wasn responsible ,1
does the really need explanation many years ago after the godhra carnage vir sanghvi former editor the hindustan times made once lifetime confession about how the indian media reports communal violence details aspx key 611 the answer suspect that are programmed see hindu muslim relations simplistic terms hindus provoke muslims suffer when this formula does not work clear now that well armed muslim mob murdered unarmed hindus simply not know how cope shy away from the truth that some muslims committed act that indefensible and resort blaming the victims course there are always ‚Äòrational reasons‚Äô offered for this stand muslims are minority and therefore they deserve special consideration muslims already face discrimination why make harder for them you report the truth then you will inflame hindu sentiments and this would irresponsible and this something most indian journalists believe but few would ever admit public forum because they know not morally justifiable view outside their ideological circle that why sanghvi was widely attacked his profession when wrote this article and not just journalists but most indian public figures who talk about interfaith and communal issues they follow these same compromises their secular idealogy mainly political construct not true secularism and hence there implicit agreement compromise when comes what they see lesser evils like muslim fundamentalists non bjp parties pandering such fundamentalists they see their duty remain silent about even support such people for the sake what they see more important goal fight the sangh parivar majoritarianism the name secularism they condone communalism ,1
fuck this one should above law hope this gets enough traction that the guilty get sentenced,-1

the buddha allowed monastics eat meat was not seen heard etc this wasn directed lay people though and there really isn anything directed lay people the theravada school for monastics very different the time they would begging for their food and what they would get would usually the left overs people food this entirely different from the meat industry today people who site this verse have completely failed consider the context for the logic rather simple how can you practice non violence towards other beings you supporting industry that kills living beings that people can enjoy their flesh people wouldn with this were humans being killed but have been culturally influenced with the case animals might make sense for christians for example who believe that humans were given dominion over animals but not for buddhists for whom all sentient beings are equal being sentient beings think buddhists who eat meat and think justified really haven given proper thought what exactly they justifying restaurants and see monks there ordering beef and all that and just makes realise more and more how far people have strayed from the dharma ,1
very clearly keep these two topics apart know group called red buddha and they say they are socialdemocrats and buddhists find this extremely dangerous making the dharma opinion something course killing bad lying bad etc nevertheless not make the dharma argument sociopolitical arguments you want cultivate compassion the way you should not really look the animals that are being killed you should look the butcher and burst with compassion this argument has not been brought forth the discussion the other day buddhists not pity the suffering creature they are pitying the one who does the negative action ,-1
mahayana monastics are cultivating much merit possible order one day attain buddhahood this marks one the biggest differences and can explain why vegetarianism only expected mahayana monastics not laity monastics seeking arhatship ,1
neither those right plenty mahayana eat meat and theravada seems have added its own rules top whatever the buddha said the buddha from reading said that for monks they should eat whatever given them unless they know was killed especially for them monks can picky eaters one reason because they depend people giving them food they starve and another that the type food depends the location some places don have many vegetables but forget about the rules for second and think about yourself the buddha said avoid harming and live harmony was even against harming plant life you take everything too literally then you end not being able eat all use your own brain how you balance out avoiding harm and eating and for monks how you avoid causing distress lay followers causing harm and eating some things you need figure out for yourself ,1

 but none gives fucking shit about these differences but they gave huge shit about these differences and that why they partitioned also most people india don give shit about pakistan for all the talk about modi bhakts how many people vote for party promising akhand bharat hell how many even consider our policies before voting how many vote thinking that the government will reclaim pok very very few modi attacks congress were mainly because claimed them weak terrorism but his main selling point was development which why people voted for him secondly people india dislike pakistan because their government policies otherwise they won give shit like mentioned too much going our own lives ,1

except that not the same people were some point but not anymore each society held together myths not religion term but more societal term and markers that form the underpinnings their culture for example partition the foundational myth india and pakistan but they both two fundamentally different myths the same event sure have markers and myths that overlap such good etc but the ones that seem really bins the two societies their own countries together are fundamentally different for good rule thumb happy share great many markers and happy that found people form anywhere really who show kindness and respect and tend judge them individual basis because people tend behave and adapt based their surroundings too give each person the benefit being individual pretty much mantra ,1

 think the hysteria and general leftie meltdown people seem confused from what understand you have green card and come from one the countries that trump banned and then leave the and return you have undergo additional background check embassy before they will allow you back assume this stop people from leaving and then getting radicalised interacting with known troublemakers from what understand they have similar requirements for citizens visiting hot countries but citizens they aren required obtain pre approval fly back into the country that unconstitutional friend mine who from america got put the fly list when went visit his dying grandfather pakistan this actual makes lot sense tbh america can control another country borders somebody flies sudan for months and comes back they might have been jihadi recruitment course and america would none the wiser also seems immigration officials are getting caught this they clearly don know what going and lot quotes that were initially pumped out the media were either false slightly inaccurate ,1

 had the exact same impression you leaving out details leftist let their imaginations control their narrative then slowly gets debunked only for another issue come has days the scotus announcement and know keep shocking the left each day and between policy hysteria can always tweet media insult which the left goes nuts over all this just driving people fed with the histrionics and move where the calm rational people are which the right gandhi was brilliant ,1

worth noting someone else pointed out this language president trump executive order notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant subsection this section the secretaries state and homeland security may jointly determine admit individuals the united states refugees case case basis their discretion but only long they determine that the admission such individuals refugees the national interest including when the person religious minority his country nationality facing religious persecution when admitting the person would enable the united states conform its conduct preexisting international agreement when the person already transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship and would not pose risk the security welfare the united states emphasis added appears that the federal court ruling not even contrary the spirit the but rather pertains the decision personnel the airport who decided detain them they can released state and homeland security wonder what happens considering rex isn place yet ,1

 looks like late how are you guys doing was grade that time and knew about from political science classes school saw much later pretty catastrophic for usa well for the world peace that many people dying withing few hours such terrible ways can remind people the jews germany way every single country almost every one them were sympathetic and ready support any course action that would take which think was the correct way hang but what followed the doesn make look good once was the pre 2000 era people have been going for jobs travelling from way too long and they had lot positive say about usa before the 2000 almost legitimized queda and such orgs this shift idea that usa might not the superpower that they are selling the world kind scary odd which pre 2000 from 1991 era was uncontested the first time read the wiki page its pretty long had roller coaster emotions the first half when felt very angry and wated murder every single those motherfuckers but when started reading the aftermath section was like fuck side ways not saying people are bad mouthing they think lesser than they would have would have been the 2000 era what are your take this does bother you does matter what lesser others think about both politically and personally was there any other course action that would have made look better sorry coming across rude sincerely someone else has already asked this question then please redirect tell ,-1
 indian particularly interested business and technology have always admired the usa for industry and the sheer size some multinational companies like general electric exxon mobil morgan berkshire hathaway and many more coming from country that still has some strains socialism left always awed the contribution american industry high science and technology india companies rarely indulge any and research mostly done either universities government agencies however from what seen the internet and various american movies and shows there seems general dislike for all things corporate how true this are the powerful companies respected there seen evil and greedy ,1

itt reddit breaking status quo and being positive about bjp,1
 think people are fed congress govt and wants see how bjp will perform and definitely not voting for congress the upcoming 2018 state elections ,1
anti incumbency against the old guard nation regional parties best organization national level seen competent and strong since leadership visible and robust modi identified the same with bjp need not accurate reality the optics are enough best marketing strategy bar none this there isn even competition its like peak sachin some fiji tourist guide and lastly momentum politics works this dynamic its bjp cycle will last few years ,1
 myself surprised but more than little satisfied the rude shock experienced all the angry nasty internet left wingers who had been spewing spite propaganda and cheap political agendas all over the internet the past few months for the election season ,-1
because they are good son ,1
people this thread are acting all expert bringing various factors that supposedly helped bjp win don complicate actually quite simple there better alternative this right here why they are making inroads into unknown territories also works you can make people believe that you the best alternative but lately all parties seem join hands bring down one party talking trash about they forgotten talk about themselves keeping bjp the limelight always ,1
because they have nabbed the pulse the common indian and they maneuver the rich poor angst skillfully keep gaining support ,-1
because nri votes are practically useless and abcds cannot vote india ,-1
bjp perceived the only major national party with vision and initiative primarily due the modi effect upa largely focuses holding back bjp and character assassinations places with perceived visionary local leader there difficult fight such delhi bihar and which could potentially eitherway other states with direct upa nda fight bjp largely performing remarkably well punjab exception due the massive mismanagement badals moreover bjp pretty amazing when comes actually campaigning and winning elections manpower isn shortage due rss support and the electoral machine pretty well organised and run right the booth level momentum also major factor and this also the reason that all the state elections are being released simultaneously march ,1
 was pune last year and fucking impressed ,1
 would say modi playing role winning locality people have been searching modi youtube and listening his speeches and the rest development doing the talking wonder what will happen when all the infrastructure being developed now gets completed dmic set complete 2018 and get electricity promised uday scheme would modi for till 2024 meanwhile bjp needs find big leader for 2024 elections ,1
because people like them better ,1
 have seen bjp doing well muncipal elections curious see the state election results especially bjp leads there then will concede bjp winning everywhere after the got into power,1
the frenemy with benefits formula has won again people maharashtra took the bait bjp sena bitch fights and has took over rest the other opposition and then kissed and made this happened the same kalyan dombivli vidhan sabha well wake and smell the coffee chutiyas potholes and garbage will still remain the same and obviously maharashtrian pride more important than basic facilities ,1
bjp winning everywhere makes worried party should have such unchecked power democracy are losing the real democracy and went through all the downvoted comments these guys not understand complete negligence the real reasons why bjp winning making bjp further stronger ,1
areas where people are fed the existing regime are looking for change and bjp the other alternative for instance people have seen the mess shiv sena has created bmc and want someone change and bjp has given that alternative and hope ,-1
 one the top developing states india more developed than bjp poster boy home gujarat have maximum reservation education have pretty much zero impact hindi not play caste pride sensibilities atleast public all these are antithesis rest india policy except for maybe normal that feel disappointed and let down rest india ,1
this sub fucking far away from the truth that you have eli5 know how popular bjp with the masses tells you how big manufactured echo chamber this place ,1
hello thanks for doing this exchange coming the this april for permanent living dallas texas what things should keep mind take care while living there thanks for suggestions ,1
welcome the reality ,1
all the reasons the thread plus our opposition shit this country has develop need strong opposition and for that congress has either get rid the family the country has get rid congress ,1
even though was and still dead against demo that isn reason for vote against them problem isn with the bjp the opposition throw all the shit you want them join you too but the question arises then what who next congress fuck local parties bsp tmc dmk aiadmk cpm rjd fuck again there just isn any other alternative and make matters worse bjp has slipped couple issues but what has the opposition done hold them accountable nothing they are highly disorganised and have clue there way like see them power because they don have spine aap whines too much they aren mature yet don think anyone would trust them with national policies educational and health are fine but foreign policy with aap don want kejri playing the victim card global stage this would resonate with many people who voted going vote for bjp the opposition spineless and clueless would stupid give them mandate this point let those shits learn the hard way and grow fucking spine till then are stuck with bjp could change things cong manages win might give them some space breath even bjp manages come second there assuming bsp wins then its easy write off congress for 2019 too this just bjps time let them enjoy actually good thing because without this back back wins for the bjp opposition would have remained blind let them learn the hard way ,1
 better choice hindutva politics garibi hatao development even though username says otherwise prefer bjp winning over that marathi hindu national socialist party shiva sena,1
let wait for and punjab ,0
idk what you are talking about bro here ,0
these are the state election winners from 2015 onwards delhi aap bihar mahagatbandhan assam bjp kerala cpi pondicherry congress tamil nadu aiadmk west bengal trinamool exactly how are they winning almost everywhere they put substantial efforts delhi bihar and lost badly they fielded large number candidates kerala and and barely made any impact for the present assembly elections they are probably losing punjab and winning goa anyone guess they rode the modi wave 2014 but post that their performance has had its ups and downs winning few municipal elections maharashtra measure dominance ,1
any the bjp candidates maharashtra are actually members from ncp and congress they are winning cause their own working and banking modi wave many urban people need alternatives there wasn visionary one before bjp also lots marketing and money distributed ,1
the reason why they are winning that because the alternative options are very weak ,1
why this suprise anyone even after demonitisation all knew that bjp was gonna get votes even had discussion this again nobody was expecting anything but bjp win only the congress cell actually believed the bjp would lose its kind sad though you would think demo would have gotten congress and the rest get their act together but nope only party with any attempts reform since 2014 was samajwadi party under akhilesh yadav time start preparing for year bjp rule and hope nobody starts murdering during that while,1
these winnings are urban areas middle class the majority and that bjp strongest zone ,0
bjp has good public image the local level know people who were desperate get bjp ticket just because this would exercise caution saying that bjp winning everywhere waiting for the results for the state elections they win all the states which little sceptical but hey you never know will admit bjp unstoppable and modi will certainly get another term ,1
 this surprise with bjp already power maharashtra ,0
 from pune and have say they have managed things very well there are new roads everywhere very very few power cuts better waste and water management and over all plenty development take the water scarcity problem last year going the scanty rainfall and increased consumption thought would have depend completely tankers for month but water was being supplied thrice week throughout summer and set time this big improvement previously there would guarantee whether get any water when get ,1
 odisha people are pretty pissed about the mahanadi fiasco and the lack general development the past decade the bjd regime congress shit because even there someone good people inadvertently relating him chota bheem next might the bjp petroleum minister fully support watching bjd govt has failed provide any reasonable benefit western odisha ,1
 bullies schools really dip kid heads into toilets thats insanely disgusting and humiliating ,-1
hardly anything changes the ground all are crooks and scratch each others back ,-1
 baffled the indifference shown various election results the congress party they are losing election after election their voter base exponentially shrinking and still the top leadership seems numb they remain stoned during election results announcements ,-1
rise indian reich,0
see the zilla parishad results bjp lost ncp beed and parbhani mumbai bjp came second and far far short majority they did not win like they did pune nagpur ,-1
 have strong feeling that bjp will trounced punjab goa and uttrakhand especially punjab going disastrous ,-1
maharashtra has almost maratha population which identifys strongly with aggressive hindutva bihar the obcs who are anti bjp that sways things against bjp largely south obcs identify with dravid politics bjp has good future next years untill obc realize how being pro hindu just front for bjp work for brahmins baniyas moreover you can satisfy all 125 crore country sooner add the the nature hyper capitalism which concentrates wealth established elites pura chaos hain india mein ,1
same reason for trump and brexit voters are fucking stupid because social media and mass advertising all these gawaar choots who don know their head from their ass are going out vote all sudden and they vote based fucked whatsapp forwards and fake tweets and end voting bjp basically bjp appeals idiots and most people are idiots,-1
 tell you what come tomorrow bjp caps monthly salary lakh per month for while order lessen the insane class divide garner even more support they have stuck serious chord with the avg indian and this gives them immense power they can harness the frustration the lesser privileged perfection ,-1
bjp not winning everywhere they are doing better municipal elections all over state elections after delhi defeat their record pretty mediocre edit fixed typo,1
seems good comeback for the congress from the 2014 debacle where they won out the seats bombay ,1
 anyone tracking all the dynastic politicians and how they are faring bjp kirit somaiya son neil somaiya seems have won any idea what has happened akash purohit son raj purohit bjp yograj dabhalkar nephew bharati lavekar bjp rohan rathod brother law ameet satam bjp deepak thakur son vidya thakur bjp harshada narvekar wife makarand narvekar bjp and others may have missed ,0
bjp pours huge accounted money the campaign takes tainted popular faces from other political parties and give them tickets alliance with multiple regional parties lot them help get extra votes give tickets gunda with contexts will elect them and change them bjp riding money power shrewd election campaign and off course people are still fed with inc ncp maharashtra currently there air for bjp but wouldn last long the elected people aren core bjp most them are either rich have own name win without any party flagship lets look bmc election they were fighting against with huge load money campaign central ministers popular bjp leaders but couldn make dent seats doubt bjp seats increased from other had ulhasnagar where their alliance with kalani party known criminal family has led them higher seats but its own came second its not all pink and won pink for bjp they are still fighting anti previous gorbment once that phase gone bjp will hit back hard reality and india shining will loose its charm remember voters elected inc for years bjp has just came power they will have thier run while does mean they are good its upto the individual guess ,1
even after trump win you are asking such questions simple called post truth people longer care about truth they care about what told them through social media and the perception that created their mind even though someone not guilty due media trial and whatsapp messages they are guilty people perceptions whichever party able establish that perception wins irrespective what the reality ,1
whenever and wherever the competition between bjp and other parties bjp struggling against congress they are winning probably they will lose punjab and while doing well goa and uttarakhand ,1
bmc elections are highly money based elections which sponsored nagar sevaks with just voters turnout bjp can win this one which mumbaikars don even care same with people maharastra pay them cash and daaru party they are yours ,1
word that 200 300 crores were spent advt campaigns for bmc polls alone more potholes seen they come power gotta get returns investment,1
people are dreaming they think will invite support from bjp will nothing short betrayal for voters every vote for was vote against bjp congress ncp mns and vice versa nor will cong ncp support them and mns doesn have the numbers but just the basis being the largest single party with seats they have constitutional right lead the bmc check the constitution folks minority government thing even bjp manages pull off tricks and get the support the ncp mns and independent corporators won have the numbers cross 114 ,1
also seems muslims voted for the congress and did not vote for mns ncp aimim much expected was expecting mns get atleast ncp and aimim get seats and congress around seats instead congress got and all from muslim dominated areas ,-1
they ride the plank development for elections which the people get hyped about since previous governments never did their jobs this development plank gets them power which point they immediately abandon and proceed with their usual kulcha shit also because hatred sells looking world politics recently ,-1
people are not aware who doing the good work and extremely good marketing skills are helping bjp win just see the response from tea cup cake they have just come power and all the plans etc that was devised before now playing out and somehow they are under the assumption that bjp did ,1
sounds like will again need bjp for alliance this time with even greater share for bjp good move udhav ,1
bjp gets seats only shy and independent supporting bjp ,-1
 used call udhav thackeray the reluctant fundamentalist soft spoken photography lover the herald his coming into own new love the air ,1
 bjp biggest party maharashtra demonetization has done nothing against them ,0
lagata hai baar bhi gathbandhan banana padega shivsena aur bjp ,0
soooo what about demonitization and its effect the polls seems like has helped the party more than anything feel there strong disconnect between the media and the ground reality they kept hinting how the tide turning against bjp due demonitization and yet here see that bjp has made clean sweep key areas ,1
fuck bjp catching mumbai looking cross mark ,1
would love see the face uddhav thakrey would have back his words and join with bjp his leadership have hear for long time when ever says anything against they will point out how they went back their words would great seeing the news debates now bjp will most likely join them since bjo leader went matoshree earlier today happy monopoly kind broken mumbai needed change ,1
funny piece from firstpost editor akshaya mishra congress leaning writer you can just feel his exasperation election 2017 congress working hard congress mukt india bjp need not bother 3299600 html also nitish kumar has publicly congratulated uddhav but word about the bjp trying attract the shiv sena into his third front how will deal with their hindutva past ,-1
‡§æ ‡§æ‡•Ä ‡§æ‡§æ‡•á,0
 short majority they probably have take support from mns and few independents ,-1
shiv sena and bjp will now again make strategic alliances various municipals and still are wondering why nothing happening the ground ,0
 bmc headed for election don think and bjp can prove majority and looks like they don want join hands either ,0
whatsapp forwards for massive reach modi cult personality amit shah shrewd identity politics,0
although the results are great quite confident this not because any modi wave its because good work done fadnavis and his team maharashtra and thats the way things should operate credit the whole bjp team and namo,1
bjp and shiv sena maharashtra really has some issues ,1

abhi saal baaki hai sir ,0
 surprised that people are worried about modi history before manmohan considered intelligentsia one has part the left brigade doubt modi could have done anything change their opinion about him just hope that when they write his history they mention cool maid and driver all who have bank accounts from the very same bank that refused give account unless some existing account holder introduces that bank ,1

unless modi creates large scale riots can simply forget the mandate has got 2014 2019 ,1
you know what still prefer him over rahul baba bhen mayawati mamta,0
 the biggest mistake modi has made making enemy the intelligentsia that fascism 101 attack intellectuals and their institutions first ,1
 think has big middle class army who can fight for him online the intellgentsia actually loosing its respect now eyes common man modi has his fair share intelligentsia support him but the media not his side showcase those voices ,1
 the upa government themselves put prison kalmadi and raja and that was sad thing both them should have got bail should not have spent single day prison without first being convicted our laws are stupid ,-1
congress cow absolutely apt term for bjp has been failure and worst don have alternative horizon his demonetization has fizzled out pretty fast without single benefit has not been tough corruption vadra still free even when centre rajasthan and haryana ruled these incompetent fucks ,-1
 the biggest mistake modi has made making enemy the intelligentsia mistake that was his best move ,1
minority appeasement scams congress stupid policies total socialist agenda hate see sonia rahul doing decision making for man mohan diggy stupid messages most ministers congress era had idea how things are working voted for modi and dont regret now municipal elections happened here most politicians had money pay for their party workers many parties spent very less this time see option replace him daily rant has effect officially bhakt now lol ,-1
let just begin making two caveats don support modi today and think demonetisation was disaster and voted for him 2014 and don regret would have done again even with hindsight that because upa was corrupt fuck and needed taught lesson having said that think you are buying for the hype that individual pms matter more than they actually see policy nation continuum indian reforms actually began the early 1980s not 1991 just that the crisis the early 1990s meant that you could stuff politically which were impossible before people confuse externally induced event with internal reform failing understand that this was fact the overall direction before well the same applies modi you actually look the policies his administration has pursued has largely stuck the status quo result there are good reasons for this the last years the top countries terms growth have been china india and vietnam that order the burger say why fix something that ain broken demonetisation was disaster yes but will short lived one the slowdown the indian economy actually began 2011 and fully manifested itself year later since then gfcf has steadily decline the savings rate has declined the npas have increased and exports have been subdued these are all contingent many factors many whom are global nature and which are not really the ambit control any indian think modi has been dealing with these issues suboptimal way has been slow deal with the npas made near impossible for rajan continue refused defend him the face bigoted attacks many his schemes are just rebrands such make india without much new thought but point being don buy your argument that singh was superstar and modi disaster modi had been elected 2004 and was able ride the global wave growth would having the same growth numbers singh presided over also say what you will but large scale corruption far less today than was upa possible that second term with modi would change that upa had far fewer scams but far can only judge what have and thus far there have been fewer scams ,1
 might failure you but the common man the road seen hero this common man because modi got access bank account this common man because demonetization saw black money hoarders being punished this common man because nda feels like the government cares for him the intelligentsia may write their books and slam modi but his reputation will dependent what parents teach their children ,-1
 hate modi and bjp ideology but this doesn mean hate india growing and prosperous india way more important than believes about political group still waiting for one good thing which genuinely doing good and make say did good job when got elected would have personally ranked him good delivered what promised this for the reason has all the majority carry out good decisions would have personally ranked him among greats delivered positive changes nefa and kashmir but doing nothing out box these two area like all other have ignored those regions completely doing nothing new years don expect him delivering big promises but its more than half his tenure and country should treading direction achieving those dreams sold billion people its routine make big announcements and months after forget about want liberal prosperous and peaceful india hope bjp looks beyond rss and start doing things for progressive india ,1
 modi history will written his greatest critics that good isn will hopefully get unbiased history also the historians will look mms with tinted glasses since they per your logic aren his greatest critics these same historians made read seperate chapters for each mughal king and delegated cholas pallavas ahoms rastrakutas single paragraphs don remember single statement made modi against these intellectuals but their pathological hate for him has made them conjure demons tldr modi hitler ,1
almost every industrialist and bureaucrat interacted with says corruption delhi zero under modi even with pinch salt that something isn ,0
 was one those who hated mms day and night but respect for him has only gone ever since this fascist has taken control,-1
just wondering why hasn the downvote brigade buried this yet ,0
 may not have the intellectuals his side but has definitely got the best team working for him and course don amit shah ,1
 may not have the intelligentsia his side but what does have great support social media anecdotally speaking any social media post even mildly critical modi attracts immediate criticism harassment from troves users for large part the population modi still above reproach don know how long that going last but for now his social media appeal and prowess insurmountable ,1

yes modi will bounce back power with 200 inch chest opposition decimated ,0
yup,0
omar abdullah this rate might well forget 2019 start planning hoping for 2024 ,0
unless they fuckup badly the next years seems likely modi has 2019 locked this also makes bit optimistic that they won take for granted and actually put decent candidate actually try get some investment here they have retain their hold here for the opposition congress needs what should done before distance itself from the gandhis but fat chance that happening akhilesh despite the loss enjoys decent popularity but shivpal and the like will try pin the loss him interesting see where that goes ,1
cherry the top will akhilesh throwing shades rahul for the loss ,1

hello american came across this headline html the headline was why these indian state elections matter the whole world but the article does nothing describe the why part can anyone maybe give some insight into why modi winning would affect the rest the world why other countries should have any thoughts this election just really curious what the political situation india like modi right wing guy left wing guy are people generally happy with him people hate him about even what are his proponents saying about him and what are him opponents also saying thanks for any feedback ,1
 worried about goa will continue get weed please don fuck goa ,-1

 means mandir wahi banaenge,0
since the live thread has been locked post here credit chanakya for the exit poll results got spot for edit got banned for god knows what nice knowing you india for the last years ,1
regarding demonitization feel that people were more affected the fact that government can take such strong step than the step itself and that what helping bjp and modi now besides his has been really good aap may have done some good things delhi but kejriwal kept making fool himself his continuous bitching about modi which frankly became cringeworthy looking what the deal modiji then admit not modi has been successful his foreign policies the world noticing india and our relevance has certainly increased they not fuck this strong mandate and keep working towards better taxation stronger growth and manufacturing lowering corruption and more transparency then 2019 totally bjp pocket without doubt and yeah fuck congress they ded ,1
smriti irani for ,0
 lol faget,1
looks right now don have any solid opposition leader aap had won punjab least kejri could keep modi somewhat check other leader sight right now ,1
bjp has not broached the topic far but hope with this mandate they actually split the state into four 2019 least the next state election needs split for the sake the country,-1
 after demonetisation many felt that narendra modi would have tough time uttar pradesh lol wut ,1
bjp was favourite win 2019 even had lost elections because would have pitched modi more aggressively against whoever would have been incumbent that time ,1
very very good signs for modi the key retaining majority for modi would difficult recover too many seats from fall seats from but this shows that the popularity modi quite high and the fall this stage will quite small ,1
2019 given unless raga grows some serious balls maybe even modi 2023 ,-1
hard say indian elections are inherently unpredictable and lot can change years for example 2014 even with the euphoria over the historic lok sabha verdict even most bjp supporters did not expect that amit shah would able sustain such performance till the assembly elections 2017 ,1
there still trace any competition from other parties might win with even bigger mandate ,1
aap chutiaap gaya,0

 more surprised about punjab results,1
 anybody wants know the quality the wire they should tune into their live election coverage ,1
yes the actual reality the ground that people don care demo was shit show its all drama actually think modi decent guy and wants good things but mostly everyone else bjp bad ,1
unlike the steak socialists randia calling them because their obsession showing how edgy they are eating beef most people were not affected demonetization beyond month and the people who are used queuing front ration shops and have average wealth 5000 rupees were not negatively impacted modi people see person who trying something his equivalents are pis poland and the conservatives under theresa may just like and europe tend meltdown why brexit happened and britain committing suicide demonetization will not hurt that much reality just like with brexit the sky has not fallen down ,1

 dont think anyone had doubts about even year back ,0
deleted 7673 what this ,0
now that bjp has its rajya sabha majority can please get the promised golden age india ,1
 really believe now demo was the make break thing and the nation has wholeheartedly embraced its not about whether the decision was successful not but govt exercising such obscene power over country maybe within constitution but felt supremely dictatorial and the way they were frivolous with people money will never sit right with went back their own word altered rules every second day was one hell shitshow but clearly the faith modi intense all this was overlooked ,1
you know what fear seeing bjp unleashed are more less aristocracy now they take some decisions that can alter the very fabric our lifestyle you thought demo was crazy was just the beginning ,-1
 think this the best outcome india country could have asked for bjp wins two states decisive fashion giving them impetus better 2019 and congress wins states keeping them relevant democracy without effective opposition cannot function ,1
 hope they try break the state into pieces that can governed better ,1
 think been great day for congress the rumours their death have been greatly exaggerated they seem taking punjab manipur goa never thought they would well great show ,1
don ask modi will win 2019 not ask who the worthy one who can oppose him ,1
 said weeks ago won 2014 and again win 2019 congratulations all bjp party members and other indians ,1
people are convinced about the muslim favouritism they voted for party that dint have even one muslim leader the most popular watsapp forward muslim becoming majority 2050 edit also hard work better than harvard,1
yes and yes locked would have locked without modi and his team get modern politics better than their opposition they would win 2019 anyway ,1
certainly hope ,1
yes modi shah brady bill belichick,0
well can safely say 2019 going non contest modi returning power rahul gandhi needs realise the only good can set internal elections congress dismantle the high command and let regional leaders lead local party activities case hand punjab ,1
without doubt there leader india that can match him right now this the worst opposition ever had and modi ruthless enough completely kill 2019 the only credible opposition will led kejriwal backed the media and supported the other parties modi then will probably riding high years governance and policy bearing its first fruits nothing gonna stop him ,-1

 should never have left state leaders like parrikar are not easily replaced his exit the main reason the bjp this situation and needs cobble together post poll alliance remain power ,-1
good that you landed earth days back you were saying impossible for bjp win people who vote people who have ideal thoughts,1
 democracy the ability give good speech very important modi very gifted that the people behind him who compile and write talking points etc are very sharp can project strong personality with semi angry speech can lighten the mood with joke can give interactive speech where orchestrates the crowd when people called him dog said happy because people recognised his loyalty when people called him ass donkey said happy because people recognised his hard working nature keeps his speeches very simple everybody can understand for more technical well researched speeches there arun jaitley for patriotic propaganda there manohar parrikar the loud voice parliament there venkaiah naidu for loud minority voice there mukhtar abbas naqvi for sane minority voice there akbar for prominent mother like female voice there sushma swaraj bjp has unparalleled public outreach that also key their success ,1
you forgot the most important point people see him extension themselves and their dreams the classic rags riches combined with selflessness‚Äã giving his all for the people and the nation and the adarsh balak qualities everyone his fans neutral and haters knows his story and connects the poor wants get out poverty through perseverance like him the youth sees him person who can change the world and the middle class sees him the person who will remove corruption this story cuts across religion class caste and gender this connection sole factor which differentiate with his competitors kejriwal had the same connection but very small level lost his way and might never able have that connect with grass root ever its politics you can never sure this connection the past track record and witch hunting msm just helps him solidify his connection and get more votes thought his popularity will fall overtime but its been exact opposite that its not cult well not yet cult fascism something like rjd bsp tmc but those are secular parties msm loves them okay bsp not much try analyse removing your colored glasses that will absolutely help you your future ‚Äãanalysis ,1
you have forgotten the 4th reason modi himself even with all these formulae very few people could have made work well ,-1
 modi offers simple direct and immediate solutions what can call the nouveau literate segments the citizenry which newly literate especially who can understand information from different sources especially social media but are still not proficient enough dig deeper and critical analysis can attack them for their lack educational credentials just conjure term that makes sound smarter than them and use that argue that they bad voters ,1
isn this big demotion moving from the defense minister india one the top four cabinet spots the and that too small state like goa why parrikar doing this ,1
 now applying this logic uttarakhand polls because well can analyse least backyard and the arguments that won bjp were double engine growth since uttarakhand special category state know that our destinies are intertwined with the government centre because the mere fact don have enough revenue generation capacity that means always wise vote for the party that centre stable government stability uttarakhand means more political bickering the janmanas the state fed the same old tiwari faction rawat faction khanduri faction nishank faction during the campaigns was visible that the bjp leaders were disciplined lot even though there was bit anguish over the inclusion rebels the other hand had harish rawat and kishore upadhayay bickering just days before the polls hell the central leadership was non existent when should have come out and stamp out such behaviour this gives signal more disciplined goverment future too courtesy amit shah second decisive mandate which led large chunk non congress non bjp voters switching favour bjp hell even harish rawat himself stated earlier that elect anybody you want but don give hung assembly comparing two speeches narendra modi and rahul gandhi can elaborate another point modi pithoragarh begins his speech asking for the blessings kul gram dieties the nearby areas then starts his speech with greetings kumaoni and the first lines albeit broken now this instantly sends message that one you now compare that with rahul gandhi speech vijay sankalp convention rishikesh where famously displayed his fatta kurta now tell which one these sends message that one you and yes the scams our beloved har ohh where start mining liqour pcs exams helicopter tour rides land acquisitions yes bjp has included several the tainted congressmen but the reason for most scams cited was warming the various factions within the people hopes with better central control this sort patronage based government would come end but hell who argue just nouveau literate segments the citizenry which newly literate especially who can understand information from different sources especially social media but are still not proficient enough dig deeper and critical analysis ,1
whatsapp brigade responsible for social messages most loyalists are whatsapp forwarders ,1
facts don matter only perception does you are right stating that people don dig deep into policy you are wrong stating that something that only applies bjp voters but that simply down your bias against the bjp modi has worked for close years gujarat gets support state because for better worse the proof the pudding the eating people saw development under him they saw law and order under him and voted him multiple times thus they naturally associated the good things that happened with him also projects himself well dresses smartly behaves well speaks well and all around does not chutiyapa like kejriwal that projects seriousness also people don want government that solves all their problems they want someone who they think they can trust not corrupt has their best interest heart and serious short they want leader modi that leader there cult around modi the best possible leader the moment people are willing look beyond his faults for the sake the bigger picture that doesn mean they are stupid this article extremely condescending and tethering the edge pseudo intellectualism the left has been getting decimated because one likes their policies their way politics anymore this article merely symptom larger disease the disease one that makes you shove your head inside your ass deep you become oblivious the outside world fwiw the only cult that exists this sub reddit ,1
 one genuine anti incumbency this still thing look punjab goa delhi there still huge negativity regarding how government functions regardless party and generally people still vote against parties show their frustration upa was probably the most outrageous government india ever had the centre with massive corruption and rampant hinduphobia ,1

 you would call pro secular pro dalit oppressed and pro social justice would happy take the label being biased well you have mentioned bias but did you post article from swarajyamag opindia and call them biased last checked thewire they had critical piece against congress when did the above right websites had modi critical piece not just that has bad team trusted wrong people needs work harder etc etc every news outlet biased should truth always biased well people here talk about being unbiased being good dont agree while course there are many shades grey times many times there are not sometimes taking taking sides with truth what required being biased towards unbiasedness implies you equal credence the scientific community and the flat earth conspiracists dont accept unbiasedness good for the sake always say balaram was unbiased krishna was not ,1

what your point the wire has anti bjp editorial slant swaraj mag has pro bjp slant you only read one news outlet for news then there something wrong with you not the news this search for this unicorn unbiased news nonsensical hell its impossible carr sums history means interpretation people will see different event differently their summaries will differ absolute truth doesn exist what truth you lie someone else this little complexity life disturbs you well then afraid the problem you unless the agency engages outright lying slander hate speech who gives shit really just read many different leaning news agencies you can their anti bjp rhetoric the bjp state with one the highest muslim population doesn field muslim candidate and some how you think that good thing hindutva cancer all forms absolutist ideals ,-1
becoz hindu terrorist won the election edit looks like all the bhakts have come out you know modi genocidal maniac had been banned from the right ,1
considering that the main stream modia dominated moditutes the wire must thinking that there may also small niche market for anti modi opinions for you check main stream modia you will never know that congress beat bjp out state elections you would see saffron holi lotus blooms kind articles all over the place most casual observers wouldn know that congress got more seats than bjp out state elections had point this few colleagues and few acquaintances ,1
because bjp under modi fascist nature also you already have enough boot lickers for modi times now zee etc,0

because news outlets today have become opinion outlets because this era where facts become alternative and money becomes mainstream zeenews swarajya timesnow right and ndtv wire hindu left each clinging their convenient facts ,1
 seems that the wire biased news organisation there any news outlet that does not have bias agenda the only variant question how much extent the bias been saying for while but there huge vaccum for actual centrist neutral media organization ,1
 seems that the wire biased news organisation you get the same impression all news organizations are biased those who claim they are unbiased should considered the worst offenders this not bad thing long competing views are allowed from other organizations ,-1
hey recorded two episodes for podcast with friend called the lake and the last two episodes talked about and mortality from the lens pop culture with almost scientific mindset kept mind not throw around technical jargons much both the episodes are about hour long incidentally the first one also has passing reference india,1
first the entire national media are being discredited modi and they removed their privileges air travel during visits lot their proxy ngos are being scrutinized for financials lot communication happening over twitter facebook rather than exclusive press meets effectively the media which they think they play important role democracy are being curtailed their privileges and modi and told them become mortal second the wire founded sid varadarajan sid lost his chief editorship the hindu because was very critical modi during 2014 elections the wire never posts any article any modi boosting but only posts modi bashing ,1
opindia shit bro most their articles are misleading spins connecting random dots here and there swaraj much better and you will see their articles india not just the bias but content quality also ,1
because they can explain the result which invalidate their pre poll rhetoric,0
because the wire left wing media outlet founded former the hindu editors siddharth varadharajan and venu they have always had visible anti bjp slant and been chronic critics the modi government their articles and opinion columns their articles are shared here because many people this sub like them for their openly anti bjp modi writings and see them role model for fearless journalism another more recent reason that venu and spectacularly failed calling this election they and other liberal leaning journalists had been believing that the bjp was struggling and expecting cong victory png the result has dealt severe blow their egos and they especially venu are struggling understand what happened and coming with overblown rationalizations about hindutva majoritarianism upper caste hegemony etc ease their own insecurity that they feel assured they were the right side after all ,1
may grudge his wife case ece which was removed and perhaps was case from chattisgarh police but the guy suffering from kejriwal syndrome thinks its modi fault and also believe some the articles published the wire are utter nonsense and third grade criticism with professional journalism some not all ,1
their coverage live election results was quite sight ,1
 hope these wretches are caught and executed for disrupting the process democracy any foreign country party that was even associated with such acts members would have been forcibly disbanded and banned from disgrace hope something changes subhuman pests like these goons are the reason turned into hellhole and clearing them would primary step the right direction ,1
the solution this totaliser machines what they mix votes from different booths maintain the anonymity votes not exactly vote through secret ballot after the introduction evms paper ballots used mixed before counting now the political parties know you don vote for them the election commission suggested totaliser machines but bjp against because prevents them from booth management ,-1

every single thing has modi why the way they are approaching tamil nadu also totally wrong selling hindutva tamil people like selling ice eskimos some the greatest temples are here and what has become hinduism now was born and nurtured here thousands years ago also the notion that brahmins are the torch bearers what you call hinduism not well received here imoposing hindi sure shot way kill any chances nothing more dear than our language state level bjp leaders appear immensely comical and absolutely relatable were bjp politician here would non brahmin the face stop selling modi people may agree with you but look your own competence before voting manage tamil media better ,1

 biggest issue arun jaitley didn even win the election spite modi wave old school lutyens type politician literally congressi saffron doesn bring anything new thought action messed many good plans far implementation orop and demonetization for example his budgets have not been inspiring not thrilled about his work with either when other ministers didn perform they have been shunted the back harshvardhan sadananda gowda but jaitley hasn seen any consequences rather creepy honestly one explanation jaitley was the one who helped modi get contacts and development after 2002 feels obliged but that still doesn make sense think has proof about modi homosexuality something which why gets free pass everything ,1

 know the bjp communal understand the deep ties that has with the rss and its view minorities especially muslims second class citizens but who else getting shit done bjp were just communal and irrational and jumla jumla then one would support that how congress thrived for years now the bjp actually getting shit done holding everyone the bureaucracy accountable little communalism can tolerated ,-1
the reason bjp supporters are bjp supporters because bjp deeply communal party ,0

they know and that why they support them but the real face modi shah now out you are wrong has always been out modi has tried hard since may 2014 shed his communal image only save their supporters from the embarrassment having admit that they support fascist regime ,-1
liberal pun intended dose confirmation bias and tendency look things black and white ,-1
the sad reality they don need convincing they already know fact that one the reasons they vote for bjp the country full diseased minds who will lead the country disaster some time the future don know how people like can escape this reality and here small difference between 1984 and 2002 bjp rss and lot its supporters are proud what they did 2002 that one their main selling points don know how congress behaved the years after 1984 but currently they don use 1984 selling point and they are ashamed and apologetic when you bring ,1
 like 2002 1984 what did bringing 2002 discussions difference they will change the narrative and people will accept,0
 think bjp supporters already know that but till most things remain check nothing wrong that ,0
 they care even riots break out and muslims are killed they could care less they will instead busy figuring out how spin and blame media fake news for spreading riot mongering ,-1
this article cringe couldn get past couple sentences ,-1
 modi has tried hard since may 2014 shed his communal image can you give one quote action took actively ignored many fringe elements the party ,1
whatever happens keep that shit ,-1
personally surprised this move because bjp has been shouting all along during the elections that they have development based mandate vikaas raajneeti making someone like yogi adityanath the quite contrary that process and sends wrong message needed someone from bjp who able stimulate sustained development and look after other social issues such crime corruption poverty water and electricity problems etc yogi adityanath the last person who even knows the abc that process frankly very much disappointed bjp supporter ,-1
yogi times what about that,0
congress gave tytler ticket when bjp gives kodnani ticket consider them communal ,0
 like after taking one step ahead bjp taking two steps back ,0
 think good yogi adityanath the the bjp out from behind the veil anyone who has the slightest inkling politics should know that the population there the brink mass communal violence the likes which haven seen before most bjp supporters are communal would surprised they don celebrate this ,1
time when you smitten with someone everything looks hunky dory ,0
tbh this what bhakts are crazy about ,-1
 think yogi adityanath would been bigger problem wasn the think about ,0
 what will convince you into accepting large people who support bjp are somewhat communal ,1
which party isn ,0
you think they don know this already but they that why majority them vote for bjp but they never admit public ,0
 glad isn sakshi maharaj ,1
 why you assume that their base thinks thats bad thing ,-1
media hated modi for decade rose the top last years ,1
showing good alternate party ,1
lol how yogi any more communal than say modi what modi past modi has made inflammatory speeches 2002 and before well don see how any modi supporter can disappointed with yogi for being hard core hindutva communal they are indeed disappointed then they hypocrites say the least ,-1
 decent full scale riot the bare minimum the any deeply communal party worth its salt must achieve justify the huge mandate given voters full blown massacre ethnic cleansing and and know they mean business ,1
here the thing large portion supporters know bjp communal and they don give damn ,1
godse portrayed evil figure but what did was necessary not saying might fit unfit lead state but equating godse with aurangzeb hitler and hafiz sayeed just degrading the man ,-1
can agree more ,1
let the bodies hit the floor ,0
 aurangazeb must have done some good his life even did impose jaziya almost all the muslim rulers have imposed jaziya there were only few exceptions akabar dar shikoh aurangazeb isn considered bad because was just following the islamic law taxation here simple example the kind things did here wiki aurangazeb learnt that sindh multan thatta and particularly varanasi the hindu brahmins attracted large numbers indigenous local muslims their discourses ordered the subahdars these provinces demolish the schools and the temples non muslims aurangzeb also ordered subahdars punish muslims who dressed like non muslims the executions the antinomian sufi mystic sarmad kashani and the ninth sikh guru tegh bahadur bear testimony aurangzeb religious policy the former was beheaded multiple accounts heresy the latter according sikhs because objected aurangzeb forced conversions though jizya was mandated initially for people the book judaism christianity sabianism was extended islamic jurists all non muslims 126 127 thus muslim rulers india with the exception akbar collected jizya from hindus buddhists jains and sikhs under their rule ,1
you are absolutely correct godse did great job killing the biggest madarchot all time ,1
 course doubt about know few people who revere him ,-1
hey atleast was straight shooter ,1

out loop what happend,0
 agree with you ,0
 course you name any person their spokesperson will say give him chance will development,0
 make mistake know the question what side the isle they favor politics much more primal than media likes portray shakti santulan¬†chahiye sansar mein aag liye paani dar hona chahiye ,1
but might still get bharat ratna also,0
godse was chutiya never saw such posts when azam khan was spreading tolerance nevertheless this appointment shocking and unexpected you and but probably reflects the ground realities the moment the hindu muslim rhetoric has won several elections just that bjp favor this time adityanath the manifestation the giant hindu vote consolidation that has happened response tactical voting the muslim community that has swung elections their favor many states including adityanath doubt hardliner hindutva proponent and would shameful indulges revenge rather than development would also interesting refrains from and gives real chance develop all modi tenure this must the greatest litmus test for him well the bjp and rss regarding their ideology and capability this can forever reinforce their hardline image help them shatter instead peddling particular image ground realities would prudent for the media stop fear mongering and report objectively ,1
this such generalizing statement any side any political argument can make replacing the nouns for example you can also say that bjp nominated god himself for cms post then congress would find reason bash him well seriously know this anti hindu anti bjp sub full boys from parts india with pakistani influence but least come with quality content ,-1
but according most liberals aurangazeb not bad just complex character with subtle nuances and product his times also maratha raids into bengal are frequently quoted justify product his times logic,1
isn godse hero already the books our bakths ,0
 praise him would understatement you would have seen them fapping uncontrollably godse all over the internet ,0
 don know about the rest india but india would melt down hard and fast like malai kulfi splattered pavement may serious note support extrimists both sides due years and years minority and vote bank appeasement policies the inc you push the majority into corner long enough and they will push back some point growth always has inclusive for the minority and the majority else keep having see saw like movements where one becomes more aggressive than the other endlessly ,-1
and what will convince gandu like you support modi ,0
from the view world politics feel that the whole world moving towards nationalistic politics like trump may modi india etc the nationalistic wave ,1
 hitler must have done some good even did kill millions more than 300 vital things were discovered created invented under his regime some the difficult but important surgeries are possible today because the research team evil doctors who experimented live jews that being said nathuram godse was rss follower who didn wanted freedom the first place because his english sahibs left him high and dry was happy that these people were cleaning toilets and eating shit never wanted govt run indians madarchod was the same poison back then which every bjp bhakts are today most them are now hiding behind development mask they want tell you development possible but only hindus can make happen ,1
 see clear parallel politics right now matter what the dear leader says matter how contrary original words his actions are always right ,1
there was time when people woukd have wholeheartedly agreed that godse will crime but our moral compass has become bigoted that there discussion whether this right wrong must say that modi genius when comes dividing society everything for discussion and all hateful things can normalised with single word vikaaaaaaaas,-1
anything that against hinduism works for conservatives the agenda national conservatism decade inside fighting weakened the india mughals and then britishers looted everything here this the main propaganda rss all hindu are indian and rest are outsiders including christian missionaries they also say muslims came from arab land and has nothing with india would like argue about hindu religon also which came from mohangadaro which was near afghan pak border the migration theory doesnt work with sangh ideology also this started when babri was demolished then happened riots several bomb blasts godhra bjp has taken advantage every right wing hindu what will happen them all vote for bjp other parties will have room india the future see where aap mim and bjp will the only survivors all this infighting will halt the progress india britishers were right about india will die fighting each other rather than moving forward ,1
you guys are really obsessed with modi aren you also who wrote that article pure cringe ,-1

the article emotive response from person whose family had bear the horrors partition and there are many such families all over the sub continent however bit over the top said earlier another post doesn capture the complexity the past the present much the discussion this thread just going around who ruled over whom merits merits partition but that not really saying anything about the situation today democracies are ruled majority but they have majoritarian tendencies and india slowly but steadily moving towards not much about modi adityanath they are just two individuals but there are deeper structural shifts happening society the faultlines were there before not something new but those are becoming more visible now the past some leaders could keep lid over but today not the case indian muslims aren going become extinct but there going increasing political marginalisation least the near term one person one vote system can really decide the course nation though majority has been made believe that the case for rest the people decide ,1

muslims present day pakistan would have never become extinct anyway since they were the majority the real problem was faced muslims and still this day love pakistan but looking back feel partition divided and our strength the educated ones migrated here and had through the wringer the hands ethnic chauvinists the poorer ones left behind were left deal with hindu extremists got left behind bangladesh because pakistan and one bothered bring back the only thing which has truly flourished our culture urdu became much bigger language and more important one too our foods spread and were liked everyone now you see punjabis and pathans eating biryani and haleem our dress was spread around and people started wearing sherwanis and ghararas and achkans formal occassions our history read every child pakistan did get something out after all although extinct big word doubt extinct our culture might have come under threat ,1

not sure the people commenting here made attempt read the article while unfortunate that such proposal being made but not for the reasons some you think the move does not legitimize black money since donations can only made through cheque electronic means infact the proposal line with the philosophy demonetization the proposal allow corporates donate political parties without the donor the receiver being identified yes this can lead crony capitalism not very difficult for donor and receiver identify each other and seek returns some way the other further just through fms budget speech you will find this proposal there too the reason for which mentioned was avoid backlash when rival political party power ,-1
does anyone know this mentioned news channels ,0
people are criticizing this and calling upon all bhakts don see anything wrong removing the limit let the companies decide what they want donate the total amount would have disclosed any case for the removing the requirement disclosing the political parties names let think through not yet sure whether like dislike thinking aloud what the reasoning behind cuts both ways one hand there need for transparency the other hand the companies run risk being persecuted political parties who didn get donations like know company hyderabad which donated equal amounts bjp congress and tdp but nothing trs and resultantly got harassed putting other way let say reliance can now donate any amount compared only 100cr earlier just example this seems fine now they donate 200cr and don disclose which party went safer thing for reliance itself for sure however knowing the breakup that donation crucial for one thing mostly sure that this change most likely the companies request birlas for example might have got tough calls from shiv sena that why did you give bjp 20cr and only 2cr ,1

there are innumerable illegal things that happen case point being guthka shops all across the stuff banned and literally‚Äã every pan shop has some form the chewable tobacco why action not being taken against that there systematic targeting being done one type business where muslims are employed lower level all the professional meat trading companies are not affected this report argues about ngt when did adani the great port construction baron india and favourite funding body bjp accept ngt guidelines infact has been rebuked many times over the mundhra port and there are lot environmental issues construction all his ports problem with media reports that always takes sides and then writes the report they should first non biased themselves before writing report like this ,1

 bsp congress and media anti bjp folks turned blind eye illegal butcheries and their impact local economy environment health for decades they consider muslims their vote bank not sure why you included congress that the last time there was congress was dec 1989 otoh there were bjp cms after that the last being 2002 ,-1
this much this the first time seen people argue let illegal and hazardous businesses keep operating illegal slaughter houses are both direct and indirect health hazards while country like india the state should something ensure the livelihood people working there isn lost there can absolutely justification keep them running ,1
fuck,-1
 now both adityanath and the centre have repeatedly clarified that the are only against illegal slaugherhouses which has many and that they will not touch legal ones the long run think this problem where the ruling party and reputation has caused exaggerated perception and fear psychosis among meat traders with some aid from the media for sensationalizing the news and not being specific with the clarifications yes cow and meat vigilantism bad and happening but that does not mean the government and police are outlawing meat their part the police crackdown only about enforcing existing laws which were deliberately not enforced the previous government ,-1
not even the congress was this zealous when came concentrating the power the state over the individual aadhar business taxmen can raids your business info dating back 1962 the only thing new raging hindutva the whole about him great reformer should die once and for all india fundamentally socialist nation only choose the social policies have not economic policies there right wing economic party india today people who pretended that modi would usher such moment should shut already how much more proof they need seems they are willing entertain the delusion indefinitely ,1

well course you should everyone shall stay why that even discussion ,0
 everyone going crazy over the paris thing pleaes some research actually educate yourself beyond the anecdotal stories about china india being some leader renewables and cutting emissions they aren and fact are some the few places where co2 emissions were expected continue rise past 2030 while most would have plateaued then anyway most countries just mailed some fell good will our best not increase fast and reduce some arbitrary number after peak co2 2030 blah blah and then not actually put plan the books one the few nations actually putting bunch money front china own propsal contributions paris climate agreement pdf says they can continue increase greenhouse gases albeit lower intensity rate until 2030 and then they will work cut that until 2040 but haven even gave specific goal what that level will they are literally doing nothing cut their emissions for more years here what the usa agreed 20first 20ndc 20submission pdf reduce our emissions below the total 2005 aggregate number while actually agreed cut our total emissions china only agreed let grow smaller intensity measured total co2 emissions percentage gdp and then just hope they will implement something actually cut since then they will produce nearly three times what the usa does here 2005 chart jpg expected future emissions the baseline the agreement sets make things graded against even before the huge drive last obama his last years get all agree were projected slow our co2 growth massively and probably would have flat lined 2030 anyway russia was also pretty small and pretty much expected flatline before this anyway while don think good that should fully ditching this and just saying fuck this noise espically when probably did put way hard burden ourselves beyond the billion year pledged give other nations the cpp proposal china outproduces the metals they need huge amounts and then regulate that industry hell and before you say the those are just factory jobs that low wages will take anyway shouldn doing that bad envriomental stuff anyway good riddance that incredibly closed minded way look world needs materials from the refining sector someone will make eventually that can either the usa making higher quality product paying workers good wages and doing safe more environmentally friendly ways china asia doing god only knows what flood the market with inferior products again not saying shouldn leaders this area got the know how the supply chains workforce public acceptance and support meaningfully reduce our emissions and then the rest the globe can adopt the new technologies create but just slashing all this production the wrong way and investing pet renewable projects that are really inefficient and not many will adopt mass scale without government subsidies aren either obama regulations did jack shit reduce our power generation from coal was purely cheap natural gas from fracking and what did they try regulate fracking more while power companies are building very efficient and clean relatively speaking course 100 nat gas power plants should investing those industries retraining workers who are disaffected the natural loss mining and refining jobs and then exporting that technology around the globe trump missing golden opportunity actually explain what this dog shit agreement feel good political victory without actually agreeing laws treates even putting ind depth plan meaningfully reduce the levels china and india have just agreed not increase 2030 peak certain intensity level but their gdp grows they could still grow total emissions faster year over year intensity measured some unit co2 per dollar gdp and the rate china going none what will really matter for shit trump should out there explaining this having plan although think the new epa guy says the epa should dissolved like get there lot inefficient ideological they pedal for cheap political capital but least propose smart reforms actually get other countries that can afford participating right now then pressuring places like china russia pakistan india malaysia indonesia iran and evnetually african nations adopt our strategies and technologies instead making look like are totally walking away ,1
the agreement still non binding anyone can say they are committed for the sake ,0
 india remains committed the 2015 paris climate change agreement indian prime minister narendra modi told petersburg international economic forum friday reporting denis pinchuk and christian lowe writing dmitry solovyov editing polina devitt that the entire article ,1
 not surprised that india still committed receiving billions aid ,-1
 yes like that money ,0
india prime minister narendra modi speech petersburg international economic forum just hours ago ,1

 want merkel succeed more than ever now but considering her track record europe needed some vision and imposing austerity joking about buying greek islands wasn really unifying leadership not merkel but the german press also kinda dropped the ball the refugee issue well let hope she sees that she and the rest don have leg stand and can get some serious work done with marcon but believe when see ,1
this the best could make original modi praises merkels vision urges climate action reduced bot standing beside modi merkel said india with its billion people partner and highest importance and that work together with such diverse country also offered opportunities for german businesses britain which set leave the 2019 wants boost trade with india the world fastest growing major economy which meanwhile also trying revive stalled decade old trade talks with the modi and merkel led joint cabinet meeting grouping foreign economy environment and other ministers their fourth intergovernmental consultations format germany has only with few countries also modi wrote before his trip that india and germany are large democracies major economies and important players regional and global affairs extended summary 23autotldr and comments are monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords india modi merkel trade german ,1
modi time put your money where your mouth and invest some money this deal like the has buys you cred ,0
 course did nothing expected india and they will probably receive money ,-1
 too would say that when the end that receiving money ,0
but burning garbage and polluting the land with garbage probably isnt right ,1
don even bother looking the commments obvious that one really has any insights this topic all you are going find are either people criticising merkel for anything she does ‚Äúshe has seeing how hard she fucked the migrant crisis‚Äú etc people that circlejerk praise her for being moderately competent politician economically powerful country which apparently how far have fucking lowered the standards for receiving praise the times trump truth she has made some good decisions and some bad decisions some her good decisions could partially attributed germany being powerful enough that things would have worked out fine either way while and she has made some bad decisions some which were choices dilemma situation where she would have received shit for choosing either way merkel such boring person you have strong feelings about her one way the other then would great time sit back and realize that you are most likely using her proxy for whatever that you really want complain about ,1

lol problems are everywhere women are getting raped everyday what doing unemployment rising what doing regular terrorist attacks isis what doing farmers dying what doing climate change shit what doing wonder what happened aha let‚Äô get back beef eating and anti romeo squads and mosque azans ,1
who benefitting from this cow thing imo made hype like church attack and award wapasi which suddenly disappeared from media ,-1
the question should rather asking anybody who doesn think getting out hands how this hasn reached breaking point for many people many them india what baffles the most about this whole term ,1
anti romeo squads are huge hit meerut and muzaffarnagar can say about other parts hell people parts uttarakhand are demanding them because girls can even colleges without being harassed have personally beaten many such scums when sister and then were college ,1
are you sitting some other country because your timestamps would off number hours that case hivemind doesn work seen people have already died this clash there need trivialise matters ,-1
divide and conquer politics from the british era are pretty much being reenacted today religion has been easy tool and has been used effectively not very far from becoming fascist country where the true patriots are those who agree with the government and treason easy crime commit ,1
will keep happening until the people come out against anti romeo squads people support pockets where such crimes against women are huge problem liquor bans women support because the men are fucking wasting their lives alcohol and they think the ban will help them get track these are populist moves and have support the masses think bjp has successfully managed make the cow issue the hindu culture being disrespected mocked and the pushback translating support for the bjp for them just social engineering and doesn help that people think democracy means majoritarianism ,1
 anyone else think  really that what everyone else thinking right now unless some miracle happens and get charismatic non bjp leader this will only get worse this regard ,1
 don know post 2014 feel like lot assholes have just become more vocal and people who agree with even part what they say decide silently ignore the unpleasant parts stand solidarity with what they believe case point when passed the beef ban few years ago there was heated discussion our karnataka based college batch whatsapp group right cue few keralite guys insisted not the government job dictate what one should shouldn eat and that people from non hindu and hindu case kerala communities consume beef violation their rights one the class creeps the kind who has been caught taking female batchmates photos without consent lost his shit and said would kill anyone who kills his mother and would proudly when asked that wasn too extreme stood his ground and the rest the batch stayed quiet well although they are usually very vocal about other things had excruciating baar modi sarkaar slew forwards for weeks leading the elections the tacit agreement was there even though the guy wasn particularly popular himself there simply didn seem platform sane enough host such discussions before and recent times has just gotten further normalized classify people into anti nationals make national sport whataboutism and ridicule you for holding any view that opposing the current government took hundred deaths before was okay criticize demonetization ,1
the more important thing the slowly creeping appetite towards violence form suppressing opposing opinions honestly the ban doesn bother much the vigilante justice mobs and yes even one mob one mob too many and don care some other religion doing possibly some other country the true sign intelligence able entertain differing opinion without accepting vigilante mobs could have gotten away with they would have loved get their hands raja ram mohan roy and other reformers violence shuts down public debate and only embitters the sides against each other because discourse impossible ,1
 people who voted for bjp will never regret any criticism bjp will met with year old level arguments and whataboutary this country perpetually fucked until get sane liberal leader and sadly dont have them now ,-1

braced for downvotes but for the complete picture need analysis whether just makeover whether there are any actual changes the provision the schemes for example know for fact that comprehensive crop insurance scheme wasn comprehensive pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana pmfby has lower premium than previous schemes provides full coverage insurance covers localized threats and also covers post harvest losses now not saying that every scheme improvement over its predecessor but would superficial say they just renamed the schemes need aware whether these are better worse after analyzing you cannot expect that every time scheme launched will brand new concept sometimes you have reboot the old schemes better way ,1
remember the only true original invention modi has been demonetisation that the reality that the bjp brigade don want face and how did that pan out gst was first tabled congress aadhar was initiated congress all those schemes that list were mostly started congress also shows that people don vote for development reform they vote for modi out tribal reasons that why they will keep voting for him even the economy goes nowhere long delivers hindu rashtra ,1

the sanghis would have riots they wanted flair the communal tensions but that sort thing can backfire against you with the sort international backlash and attention generates lynchings are the perfect plan because you kill one muslim per day the number would never high generate outrage the pro govt media channels people and newspapers would mostly ignore not play much bigger issue with daily lynchings there would come time when this would daily occurrence people would become apathetic and one would care ask questions the govt would still continue label every non bjp state mini pakistan and continue flair the resentment against mainorities make mistake today muslims tomorrow they will come for sikhs weaving imaginary khalistani story and arnab and rahul shivashankar sell for them when they done with them then they will turn christians and buddhists and dalits and that will the time when the talibanization this country would complete when there will more imaginary liberals bash and cows milk when the opposition would realise that only hindutva sells and they would reorganize their own strategies and rewrite their own manifestoes that will the time indians would sorry that they never spoke out when there was still time ,1

 hindu don eat beef love cattle and see nothing wrong with true cow protection however clear that this new generation gaurakshaks have little with actual animal protection they are simply thugs looking cause communal violence and strongly condemn their acts well the government for not clamping down them ,1

 think the issue here what white western people may treat minorities better some ways compared other cultures but that would only mean that treat them well comparison not that treat them well they ought for instance citizens the united states are entitled free primary education but the education system that put place serve citizens not effective educating everyone equally this sort gesture allows the majority assume that they are being fair minorities just look how other countries treat minorities when reality there still much done treat minorities how they ought treated ,1
can you help understand your view telling why you grouped together white western people there lot heterogeneity the policies western countries america norway germany france and australia all have very different approaches justice housing and social issues but your view lumps them together how come ,1

america basically invented chattel slavery and were still lynching people less than 100 years ago america almost completed genocide native americans america interned all americans with japanese ancestry during ww2 and confiscated all their property your premise just wrong ,-1
because all the standards you choose measure are just social programs that exist first world liberal democracies they have exactly nothing with how western white people behave western white people are not the same thing their governments you asking about how people treat each other then you need differentiate between our social technologies like freedom religion speech and the other tools sophisticated democracy and white people ,1
 not going into the fact that you probably incorrect assuming that white people treat their minorities better than every other respective ethnic backgrounds lot these sources seem very cherry picked but going off the assumption that you correct going with the assumption that you talking about racial minorities instead something like religion since the point you bring specifically white people might have with the quantity minorities for example asian countries the number minorities are insignificant south korea they have minority percentage compare that place like the where the country are part minority ethnicity obviously these are very specific places but places like india might have religious intolerance but seem not even count people different races living there minorities what getting feel like you really need more thorough unbiased research some countries have more tolerance other religions but less races some are the opposite putting down the very specific white people treat other minorities better than other racial backgrounds but then comparing place like indias treatment people certain religious background instead racial seems very cherry picked you are very vague when you say western white people which encompasses huge variety countries but then you specify few countries that aren western white this isn very controlled research for the rest the countries consider looking into racial treatment minorities countries that aren predominantly white but also considered modern first world country using modern first world country like the picking this one since you named countries that are western white yourself and comparing place like afghanistan like comparing apples oranges ,1
canadians and americans have treated black people totally different their respective history you can not place those countries under the same umbrella ,-1
your problem seems how you evaluate the behavior various societies ultimately you are evaluating them based western moral values considering this hardly surprising see your conclusion ,1
india had woman prime minister 1960s waiting for woman president since 1776 all indian citizens got the right vote 1951 all american citizens got the right vote only 1965 india has long history oppressing muslims since independence their current modhi the process enacting laws hurt muslims how enacting legislation improve supply chain act law hurt muslims india treats its minority far better than along with freedom religion india also sponsors hajj pilgrimage mecca for indian muslims every year doesn sponsor india had muslim presidents zakir husain 1967 mohammad hidayatullah 1969 fakhruddin ali ahmed 1974 abdul kalam 2002 and sikh president giani zail singh 1982 1987 leader india biggest opposition party congress italian born christian sonia gandhi india former prime minister was manmohan singh 2005 sikh you conveniently didn mention police brutality racist jury system that rarely convicts cops accused killing blacks the for profit prison system that makes money housing inmates color primarily blacks the only reason birther issue was made big deal because obama black mainstream america can deal with growing prosperity and power minorities one the reasons why trump was elected ,1
assuming you judge everyone the same scale and judge them the same standards which not very intelligent opinion then you are correct what would make more sense think about how america failing living its own basic standards and when you are the standards are supposed higher than this for reason comparing ourselves saudi arabia not going help the fact the matter that many countries were americas position they would better job comparing america countries that are not americas position not very useful for proving any relevant points ,1
you act like minorities western countries aren murdered with consequences the bloody sunday massacre unarmed irish gunned down police happened 1972 the massacre has been known around the world courtesy turns out the answer how long must sing this song was 2010 since then one person has been arrested for this incredibly well publicized instance murder unarmed civilians and you look the list killings law enforcement officers you see list with hundreds people every single year while other western nations have few police killings india has its share murders the muslim minority but those murders are not performed the police part their duties and not the hundreds they are the united states the drug war itself part campaign persecute and murder black americans and destroy their communities per aide nixon invented the drug war decimate sent prison scapegoat for watergate and that war racial persecution under the guise law continues this day western nations particularly the are just better about hiding their murder and persecution especially hiding behind the law ,-1
uhh uyghurs massacre the chinese believe you have your facts mixed ethnic minorities get the equivalent affirmative action china the chinese state tries control religion because doesn want home grown terrorism china white people are even more privileged china than their home countries you write like person that has never traveled outside the the does not treat its minorities relatively well ,1

many your points such welfare education healthcare are services that are offerred all citizens not special service only offered minorities such only indicator wealthier and more socialist society not indicator society that treats minorities especially well your logic similar western countries have better roads and infrastructure minorities get use this better infrastructure along with everyone else and hence minorities are treated better western countries this wrong logic you can only prove this you can prove that non western countries not let minorities use the social infrastructure their other majority citizens other words they treat them worse relatively speaking point you have done lot cherrypicking will take india example india has had very long history assimilating minorities into its society and very tolerant society well you also have take into account that far more populous country far denser country terms population density far poorer country most importantly has far more diversity than most western european countries the reality western european countries are only superficially tolerant minorities because has never become big enough issue for them they are wealthy lead fairly insular lives and their lives really not get affected when they take small measured quantities minorities controlled doses acts generosity challenges with minority diversity religious beliefs etc only become true challenges when people are jostling each other constantly for limited resources limited cultural space when cultural pactices are constantly intruding your daily lives when you have dozen mosques your immediate neighborhood all blaring the namaaz call times day while you also have dozen hindu temples that blast religious songs loudspeaker during festivals while you also have roads blocked off because observed christian festivals and processions and you have deal with all this while you have scramble for work nwxt morning when you are daily wage earner earning peanuts and have take overcrowded public transportation again jostling hundreds people from all walks life and all religions and ethinicities this far cry from the peace and quiet you enjoy your hermetic ikea home while you get work clockwork precision and tidiness and more importantly the immigrants and minorities not disturb your daily bliss all course you can generous and benrvolent but consider the chaos and poverty consider that population billion people crammed into megacities and with the second largest muslim population the world more muslims than probably the entire middle east still live fairly peacefully point put the right context denying the religious riot that happened 2002 but also note there have been religious issues after that well and that too under the rule the same political party anything india laws aggressively protect minorities minorities india have full access the social infrastructure others mosques and churches and gurudwaras and zoroastrian fire temples and synagogues coexist quite peacefully with hindu temples even extremely crowded urbanized cities minorities also vote equally and most cases are more aggressive politically and get their minority candidates voted who also safeguards their interests and rights despite being contentious isssue india laws for minorities are far more sophisticated and evolved compared most western european countries personal law and marital law for example tailor made respect and protect minority religions hindu personal law for example very different from muslim personal law which dfferent from christian personal law there are religious law board that provide advice and feedback courts and government all religious and personal law issues you look any population running into billions you will likely able cherry pick the worst that humanity has offer but consider looking the totality including the enormity the challenge and how vastly more complex this challenge for country like india and remember only when you are scrabbling daily eke out living when you are competing for extremely limited resources overcrowded society when all the ugliness all the clannisness and tribalism all the xenophobia rises the top just look how little took for the alt right movement the xenophobia the muslim hate the brexit kick ,1
 would like say firstly that there are certainly regions where minorities are treated better than the west funnily enough china one those regions the ughyrs are essentially the only exception and that primarily due their own extremly racist views directed essentially every other racial group china ffs they started city wide race riot that went around targetting and killing people based upon their race china has over indigenous minority groups their are only issues with couple and even those issues are with fringe elements from within those groups moreover china gives her minority groups significant set advantages for one they get boost their national exam scores and are more viable candidates for state funding they have always been exempt from the one child policy and larger concentrations minority groups will given far higher levels autonomy should they have established area native them this isn always applicable many groups were traditionally migratory now compare this how australia canada and the usa treat their indigenous minority population the promises autonomy and reservations for natives but only the least productive and desirable land futhermore they then violate these treaties and deals build oil pipelines through these areas over the protest the natives and their supporters fact riot police were sent violently repel the protestors they obstructed contruction and surveying the aborigenees australia are essentially invisible the whole their society and are treated like dirt they have very few methods earning money and are placed reservations similar the usa which obstucts their traditonal migratory lifestyle canada there similar situation just that these issues aren prominent western new reporting and media wonder why while they instead focus the injustice regions far away from home afterall you angry and protesting against some far away nation all you doing giving your government moral highground while simultaneously allowing the inequalities within you own country fester note will update more later once actually computer some sources and more info can hurt but are difficult write phone ,1
why are you saying white people instead saying westerners this very clearly about culture not race you think race determines how tolerant person then you are racist you don then you making things more complicated and less accurate referring skin color instead referring country and culture ,1
 far know sierra leone has never had any notable ethnic religious conflict large scale discrimination since the colonial era and any conflict around that time was mostly due white westerners meaning been treating minorities equally for least century longer than pretty much every white western country ,1
 really not sure what exactly the point your post you asking for evidence that communist dictatorships and theocracies treat their respective minorities more fairly than societies based secular democracy doubt you going find any takers that point though not sure ever heard anyone actually make that argument what view are you trying have changed ,1

sorry interrupt the circlejerk but right information not the right ask government officers any question and expect answer there request data policy information not covered under rti whatever you have asked for covered under various acts like the aadhaar act through the bill read the liability clauses anything ambiguous you can probably ask any notifications have been issued clarifying the said sections but you are not obliged answer this under the rti act this was true upa era and remains true modi era you feel you can bring about some sort social change filing these stupidly formed rtis please just leave social activism entirely ,1
sue all them for compensation for inconvenience caused loss interest income court fee charges only court can help you now ,0
the rti act does not permit asking questions rather ask for copies the information available either print electronic format hence the response from pmo india the wording can changed get better response like below copy documents relating the protocol followed designated agency when aadhaar number bio metrics individual misused the entire premise your rti application seems more like rhetoric question raised reporter news channel there are enough loopholes rti act counter such questions more aware the process use more effectively ,1

upa was good maybe even marginally better upa was jackshit not only the second upa era gave rise numerous scams but also made sloth the economy raised our corruption perception worldwide and general brought much trouble which effected middle class like directly remember inflation rates remember new scam unearthing every month those things are history atleast for now for common man much hate corruption effects him more than communal tensions you may have communal incident once week once month but crime statistics wise they are miniscule not justifying supporting any communal activity here inflation and corruption directly effects people you will need interact with some govt official sometime your life you well need buy commodities and food survive communal incidents are rather unfortunate events which can avoided and controlled want other issues that people raise here gst bullet train aadhar rera jan dhan cashless etc people need realise that these are the steps need take sooner later order develop any nation needs have single national tax instead madrid taxes any nation big india needs single citizen identity any nation needs have real estate regulated any nation big india needs faster and hassle free transport need bring poor people banking finance give them financial benefits need find ways use cashless methods for hassle free economic activities you want improve them fight for their right implementation not the ideas make the govt responsible for aadhaar privacy find solutions make gst filing hassle free see how you can have regulated real estate that beneficial both home buyers and builders the above idea can extended demonitisation too much want many people are not ready believe that modi carried out demonitisation for his own personal benefits that doesn sell his stature the eyes the people are even higher than that was botched execution many people agree with that but not that his intent was wrong then there are issues that are handled well foreign relations for example now people can dismiss india diplomatic victory over china chest thumping and hypernationalism for bhakts but today world incidents like these effect economics well are not pushover nation anymore can guard our interests well this also gives rise economics perception and more and investments thus lifting more people out poverty ,1
ehhhh yes and firstly the big deal that the bjp calls the shots not weak coalition dependent crazy regional parties they don have give insanity magic nuclear deals being given platter the usa they have more cohesion and state support party they can actually execute plans and can way better optics the same time they don have make consensus they don have the same technical depth and talent they have support crazies their own party ,1
you are example what wrong with this country while acknowledge demo issue gst needed every developed country has need more than others have 500x more people have many things cant keep every single thing complicated forms its working then don fix the heck wrong with you man you really think its applicable policy how many man hours should normal people spend only suffer infinite tax regimes you want help business grow make easy build and grow business ofcourse gst far from perfect you cant make perfect one shot neither can you wait for eternity besides with different parties majority both and our gst just simplified regime but almost similar the previous one but start you must understand that most the changes that have helped the country were organic there was little involvement the political parties there was need update ourselves people voters people with money felt the need pushed whoever was top implement the change these things would have happened with without upa bjp besides gst was upa idea along with aadhar both were held back and opposed bjp only crap politics being played allowed bjp put their label common man that shouldn our concern much shit getting done you want develop and first world nation while following mughal era and british era policies how the fuck because our inaction policies even tried and tested things other parts the world are mere shadow presence ffs don want people identify india home religions peaceful people culture and shit are 7th humanity just cannot expect everyone delve into spirituality and shit must longer economic administrative scientific practices reserch development manufacturing status quo nation should have changed that over years ago must have begun after our economic liberalization period best can maintain our status quo geopolitics culture for now tendency for compassion that change organically well most changes that people and you talk about happened organically political parites had little with apart from stamping official seal you don let happen organically you get replaced ,1

 don see nda politicians are stealing all our money but upa did didn see any riot till now caused some inconvenience and will likely but far better than stealing all money attacking the majority for reason and putting puppet saw the consequences puppet rulers for 300 years and don really think good idea upa also engaged accusing rival parties more than ruling the country nda does but not like upa ,1
 only who was terrified terror attacks during upa regime there were numerous attacks like once month thought that was mostly due the soft stand terror that perspective feeling little bit safe london attack reminded those days ,1

economy was already doldrums during upa govt has been functioning better under nda even the wire reported couple days ago that almost all schemes are working better under nda nda has failed kickstart the economy despite being helped low crude prices and general positive outlook towards investment india abroad they should pulled for that doesn improve the remaining two years for the intolerance nonsense nope not going vote upa for that they are equally communal having sided with aimim iuml and other islamist parties the gandhi family has killed more minorities than modi and all his friends put together nellie and 1984 ,1
the earlier tax regime was horrendous the its working then don fix condition does not apply the reality that both upa and nda have been trying change the tax regime gst for the last years upa couldn their last term because modi blocked and their political position was weak because all those scams nda managed because strong numbers the lok sabha and large number state election victories but nda implementation gst has been horrendous overall the govt should criticized for poor implementation gst but not for introducing gst all economists and policy makers both domestic and international agree that gst will bring long term structural benefits the economy ,-1
without doubt was much easier business today just hassle most the laws that have been enacted the last years are completely unthought and borderline retarded legislations upa had its scams and bribery going but compared what have today stagnant economy atleast things were moving during upa rule ,-1
upa was terrible this govt compared upa way better scams insipid ngo raj economic slowdown slothful government was terrible years enough upa gaslighting ,-1
make the lives the poor and middle class unbearable and you dug your own grave ,1
 things which affect directly the upa era was lot better than the current one ,1
demonetization correct step towards increasing tax base india but implementation could have been better gst will have negative impact indian market for short term due understanding will take time same happened with vat but long term the positive doing nothing sitting laurel wanted this should have voted for upa ujwala scheme gas give there many other things the government doing right will take time give the guy credit for thing doing ,1
lmao,1
upa era was equally shittyor even more you should have seen reddit kulcha back then ,1
 was certainly happier the upa era and more prosperous ,1
don equate demo and gst both are giving troubles but one isn like the other cocaine and chemo therapy ,-1
 don actually care about the statistics but rising intolerance religious stupidity and forceful policies are giving creeps actually went wtf when beef got banned even distressing was people reaction have seen friends supporting every ill stuff from ban killings with stupid reasons you have opinion otherwise you are compartmentalized into congress aaptard leftie commie and stuff also marginalisation violence its like people have gone desensitized them know these things might have been there during every times but watching conspicuous transition was scary either have gone more politically conscious something has gone wrong around ,-1
 its working don tinker bad idea thought people would know more about creative destruction,1
 don know real but either way dat funny ,1
doh upa era had that was remote controlled family upa was disaster synonymous with policy paralysis and who can forget loan waver schemes scores scams and double digit inflation public memory very short the question will you vote for modi again you have conviction that raga can provide good governance imo the central level the inc simply spineless they just don have any voice and absolutely leadership modi capitalising this demo gst glitch cow lynching these are temporary blip come 2018 people will forget these issues none these issues are going affect the vote bank negatively fact modi will sell these things along with bullet train for his 2nd term ,1
while dislike both congress and bjp but the correct view congress corruption bjp corruption violence cow shit etc edit also know that the execution project seems faster the bjp regimes but can cope with the corruption and violence have vote will vote for aap the present scenario their execution projects much faster plus without corruption plus they save money almost every project which can used help poor citizens also imagine was upa power and they had invited isi our air base what would the reaction the bjp ,-1
oof sizzle ,0
forget everything least people weren murdered broad day light for what they eat upas time but that didn meant that they didn fuck administration and corruption and right now with every worst features upa with added features state sanctioned killing people for what they eat plus glorifying past illusions national fav pastime now ,-1

bhai tum sab sala bhul gaye 2012 end the year sala government joke ban gaya tha har hafta mei koi scam raha tha aur india military majak ban raha tha this goverment normal mediocre bad inept goverment but upa government was embarrassment this country ,-1
upa was disaster there were multiple power centers and the least powerful there was policy paralysis all decisions got postponed their handling telangana formation was how they functioned there was confusion all around finally they separated telangana from and tried take political mileage and got rejected both telangana inflation reached double digits rupee went into tailspin gdp plummeted npas crippled the economy all energy was spent defending itself from scam after scam coal cwg shunglu agusta westland antrix etc maoists became the terrorist organization the world terms nos people killed surpassing qaida taleban boko haram and mid way through the tenure the economy entered stagflation that lasted even after upa tenure got over ,-1

 computer software world there adage its working then don try fix that not true almost all good companies and all strong technical teams emphasize paying down tech debts sooner than later you should find better job you are the software industry don like people tinkering with existing stable systems especially when even the slightest change could bring about disaster you may comfortable with the status quo but some want progress and that brings about some disruption simply part this government has the vision and the mandate bring about changes like this and welcome you complain about the implementation stand you but you are against tinkering existing system you are part the problem would rather have the government sit their laurels not doing anything than poke finger established and working systems yes laurels like the country with the most number people under poverty line one the most difficult places start business the one with the most number people dying hunger and malnourishment with your privilege you may not have face any but fuck the established and working systems want better not just for myself but countrymen demo did not well but gst welcome move ,1
